# Contributing to ArthSaarthi

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This document outlines the development process we follow, which is guided by an AI Master Orchestrator.

## Development Process

We follow an Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), developing features iteratively. The process is divided into distinct stages, each managed by the Master Orchestrator invoking specific AI-powered roles.

### AI Roles

-   **Master Orchestrator**: Guides the entire development lifecycle.
-   **Requirement Analyst**: Gathers and defines functional and non-functional requirements.
-   **Solution Architect**: Designs the high-level system architecture and technology stack.
-   **UI/UX Designer**: Creates wireframes, mockups, and defines the user experience.
-   **Backend Developer**: Implements the server-side logic and APIs.
-   **Frontend Developer**: Implements the client-side user interface.
-   **Database Administrator**: Designs and manages the database schema.
-   **QA Engineer**: Defines and executes the testing strategy.
-   **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure.

### Development Stages

1.  **Stage 1: Requirement Gathering**: The Requirement Analyst defines the project's features and constraints.
2.  **Stage 2: Architecture & Design**: The Solution Architect designs the system's structure and selects technologies.
3.  **Stage 3: UI/UX Design**: The UI/UX Designer creates the visual and interaction design for the application.
4.  **Stage 4: Module Development**: Features are developed iteratively. For each feature, the relevant roles (Backend, Frontend, DB, QA) collaborate to plan, implement, and test the module.
5.  **Stage 5: Deployment**: The DevOps Engineer prepares the application for release.

All decisions and plans at each stage require confirmation from the project owner before proceeding.

## Commit & Documentation Process

To maintain consistency and ensure all work is properly documented, all AI assistants must follow a standardized commit process at the conclusion of each task.

### The Golden Rule

**Code is not "done" until the documentation is also done.**

### Workflow

1.  **Implement & Test:** Complete the code implementation and ensure all automated tests (backend, frontend, E2E) are passing.
2.  **Update Documentation:** Systematically review and update all relevant project documents. This is a critical step to keep the project's history and status accurate.
3.  **Finalize Commit:** Use the official commit template to generate a clear, conventional commit message.

For the detailed checklist and the commit message format, refer to the **Commit Template**. The Master Orchestrator will enforce this process.

**ArthSaarthi** is a self-hostable, privacy-focused application designed to help users manage their personal investment portfolios. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for tracking assets, analyzing performance, and making informed financial decisions.

The application is designed for flexibility and can be deployed in two ways: as a multi-user **web service** using Docker for self-hosting, or as a simple, single-user **desktop application** that requires no external database, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

The project was developed following a rigorous, AI-assisted Agile SDLC, with a strong emphasis on automated testing, comprehensive documentation, and iterative feature implementation.

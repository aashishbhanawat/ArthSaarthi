## 2025-07-19: UI Refactor Postmortem & Mitigation Plan

### 1. What Happened?

The objective was to refactor the application's UI to a professional, unified design system. The process was difficult and marked by several key challenges:

*   **Symptom-Focused Fixes:** We initially approached the problem by fixing individual components. While these changes were necessary, they were treating the symptoms, not the root cause.
*   **The Hidden Root Cause:** The fundamental issue was not in the component code but in the **build system**. The frontend was missing the necessary Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`) and the required npm packages (`tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`). This meant that our global stylesheet (`index.css`) was never being processed, so none of our custom classes like `.card` or `.btn` were ever being generated.
*   **The Truncated Response Issue:** My attempts to provide large, multi-file fixes in a single response were failing due to technical limitations, causing my code blocks to be cut off. This broke the workflow, made it impossible to apply the fixes, and led to significant frustration.

### 2. What Was the Impact?

*   **Wasted Cycles:** We spent considerable time applying fixes that could never have worked until the underlying build configuration was in place.
*   **Erosion of Confidence:** The cycle of "apply this fix" followed by "it didn't work" is demoralizing and rightly caused frustration.
*   **Broken Communication:** The truncated responses were a major communication failure, making it impossible to deliver a complete solution and forcing a painful, iterative process to get the full code.

### 3. Actionable Plan for Future Work

Based on this analysis, here is a concrete plan to mitigate these issues and ensure a smoother development process going forward.

#### 3.1. Foundational-First Approach for System-Wide Changes

When tackling a problem that appears to affect the entire UI or a core system, we will adopt a "foundation-first" diagnostic approach before touching any component code.

1.  **Verify the Build & Style Foundation:**
    *   Confirm that `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` exist and are correctly configured.
    *   Ensure `package.json` includes all necessary build-time dependencies.
    *   Verify that the main CSS file (`index.css`) is correctly imported into the application's entry point (`main.tsx`).

2.  **Isolate with a "Canary" Test:**
    *   Before refactoring a component, we will add a simple, unique "canary" class to the global stylesheet (e.g., `.test-red-background { @apply bg-red-500; }`).
    *   We will apply this class to a single `<div>` on a single page.
    *   If the canary style does not appear, we know the problem is with the foundational build process, not the component itself.

#### 3.2. Mitigating Truncated Responses

This was a technical failure on my part, and the best way to solve it is to change how I structure my responses for complex tasks.

1.  **Proactive Chunking:** I will no longer attempt to provide large, multi-file changes in a single response. Instead, I will proactively break the work into logical, single-file chunks.
2.  **User-Guided Workflow:** The process we eventually fell into is the correct one. I will start by providing a list of files that need to be changed and then ask you, **"Which file would you like to work on first?"** This puts you in control and ensures each step is complete and verifiable.

#### 3.3. Documentation as a Standard Practice

*   **Update the `LEARNING_LOG.md`:** After any major refactoring or feature implementation, we should update this document with key architectural decisions and new patterns.
*   **Update `bug_reports.md`:** We will continue to rigorously document all bugs, as you correctly insisted.

## 2025-07-24: Validating the Refined Workflow

### 1. What Happened?

We undertook a major stabilization of the backend test suite, which was failing with 11 errors.

### 2. How Did the New Process Help?

*   **Rigorous RCA:** Instead of fixing test by test, we analyzed the logs and identified two root causes: an incomplete `FinancialDataService` and outdated test helpers that didn't match the new `AssetCreate` schema. This prevented a long, frustrating cycle of fixing symptoms.
*   **Foundational-First Approach:** We fixed the service layer and the test helpers *first*. This resolved the `AttributeError` and `ValidationError` issues at their source. The subsequent `AssertionError` failures in the dashboard tests were then easily diagnosed as incorrect test mocks, which was the final piece of the puzzle.

### 3. Outcome

The new workflow proved highly effective. By focusing on root causes and fixing foundational issues first, we were able to resolve a complex cascade of 11 test failures efficiently and methodically. This validates our new process and gives us a solid playbook for future development.

## 2025-07-27: Pilot Release Stabilization

### 1. What Happened?

We implemented two major, inter-dependent features simultaneously to prepare for the pilot release:
1.  **P/L Calculations:** Complex business logic was added to the dashboard to calculate realized and unrealized profit and loss.
2.  **On-the-fly Asset Creation:** A new user flow was created, touching both frontend and backend, to allow users to add assets not present in the pre-seeded database.

This phase involved a high volume of changes across the entire stack and required careful coordination between backend and frontend development.

### 2. How Did the Process Help?

*   **Feature Planning:** Creating separate, clear feature plans (e.g., `06_pl_calculation.md`) for each major piece of work was crucial for keeping the development focused, even when the work was happening concurrently.
*   **Test-Driven Development:** Adding dedicated test suites for new backend endpoints (`test_assets.py`) and updating existing ones (`test_dashboard.py`) was essential. It allowed us to isolate and verify the complex business logic of each feature before full integration.
*   **Rigorous RCA:** The workflow helped identify subtle bugs, such as the `KeyError` in dashboard tests when the mock data structure for `get_current_prices` changed to support the "Top Movers" feature. A rigorous RCA correctly identified the test mock as the root cause, not the application code.

### 3. Outcome & New Learning

*   The "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" workflow scales well even for complex, concurrent feature development. The discipline of creating feature plans and writing tests first prevents chaos.
*   **Test Mocks Must Evolve with Application Code:** This phase highlighted the importance of keeping test mocks in sync with application code. When a service's response structure changes (like `FinancialDataService`), the corresponding test mocks must be updated immediately to prevent misleading test failures.

## 2025-07-29: E2E Test Suite Implementation

### 1. What Happened?

We built the foundational end-to-end (E2E) test suite from scratch using Playwright. This was not a simple task and involved a deep, iterative debugging process across the entire application stack.

### 2. How Did the Process Help?

*   **Systematic Debugging:** The "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" workflow was absolutely critical. The E2E environment is the most complex part of the system, as it involves the interaction of every service (`db`, `redis`, `backend`, `frontend`, `e2e-tests`). We faced a cascade of issues, including:
    *   **Docker Configuration:** Incorrect `baseURL`s, missing `curl` in base images, Playwright version mismatches, incorrect `.env` file loading order, and healthcheck failures.
    *   **CORS & Proxy Issues:** Complex interactions between the Playwright test runner, the Vite dev server proxy, and the backend's CORS policy.
    *   **Backend Startup Logic:** The backend was not correctly entering "test" mode, and the database reset logic was not robust.
*   **Rigorous RCA:** By methodically analyzing the logs from each container, we were able to pinpoint the root cause of each failure, from a single line in a `Dockerfile` to a specific setting in `vite.config.ts`. This prevented us from getting stuck in an endless loop of "it's not working."

### 3. Outcome & New Learning

*   **A Stable E2E Suite:** We now have a reliable, automated E2E test suite that validates our most critical user flows. This is a massive asset for future development and regression testing.
*   **E2E Testing is a Feature:** The most important lesson is that the E2E test environment is a feature in its own right. It requires the same level of planning, implementation, and debugging as any user-facing feature.
*   **Configuration is King:** In a containerized environment, a single misconfigured environment variable or network setting can cause a cascade of failures that appear unrelated to the root cause. A deep understanding of the full-stack configuration is non-negotiable for E2E testing.

## 2025-07-31: Full-Stack Test Suite Stabilization & Final Feature

### 1. What Happened?

A final, intensive effort was made to stabilize all test suites (E2E, backend, frontend) and implement the last MVP feature (Advanced Analytics). This process uncovered a critical race condition in the E2E tests and revealed that the entire frontend unit test suite had become obsolete and was failing after numerous component refactors.

### 2. How Did the Process Help?

*   **RCA for Flaky Tests:** Analyzing the E2E test logs was instrumental in diagnosing the root cause of intermittent failures. The key insight was that Playwright's default parallel execution model was causing multiple test files to reset the same shared database simultaneously, leading to a race condition.
*   **Process Refinement:** The solution was to enforce serial execution by configuring Playwright to run with a single worker (`workers: 1`). This eliminated the race condition while allowing the test files to remain modular.
*   **Systematic Test Suite Overhaul:** After stabilizing the E2E tests, we discovered the frontend unit test suite was completely broken. Instead of patching individual tests, a "rewrite" approach was taken. For each failing component test, a prompt was used to generate a new, correct test suite from scratch, which proved to be much more efficient.
*   **Full-Stack Debugging:** The "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" cycle was applied across the full stack to implement and stabilize the new analytics feature, catching bugs in the backend logic, the frontend component, and the frontend test mocks.

### 3. Outcome & New Learning

*   The entire project is now in a fully stable, "green" state. All E2E, backend, and frontend tests are passing.
*   **E2E Test Execution Strategy:** For tests that mutate shared state (like a database), parallel execution is a significant risk. Enforcing serial execution is a valid and often necessary strategy to ensure reliability and eliminate flakiness.
*   **Unit Test Debt is Real:** Component refactoring creates test debt. It's crucial to budget time to update or rewrite unit tests to keep them valuable. The "rewrite from scratch" approach for a broken suite can be more efficient than trying to patch dozens of individual failures.

## 2025-08-11: Data Integrity in Batch Processing

### 1. What Happened?

During manual E2E testing of the data import feature, a critical bug was found: if a user's source CSV file contained a 'SELL' transaction row before the corresponding 'BUY' transaction row, the import would fail. The backend was processing transactions in the exact order they appeared in the file, leading to a validation error when it tried to sell an asset that hadn't been bought yet.

### 2. How Did the Process Help?

*   **User Feedback is Key:** This bug was not caught by automated unit or integration tests, as they used perfectly ordered test data. It was discovered through manual E2E testing that simulated a real-world, imperfect user file. This highlights the value of manual testing for uncovering edge cases related to data quality.
*   **Targeted Fix:** The fix was not to change the individual parsers, but to address the problem at the orchestration layer. By sorting the list of all parsed transactions *after* parsing and *before* committing, we ensure that the business logic always operates on a correctly ordered set of data, regardless of the source file's quality.

### 3. Outcome & New Learning

*   The data import feature is now more robust and resilient to common real-world data issues.
*   **Data Integrity over Source Order:** When processing financial transactions in a batch, never assume the source data is correctly ordered. The application must enforce logical order (chronological, by asset, etc.) before committing any data to the database to ensure data integrity. This principle is fundamental to any batch processing system.

## 2025-08-14: Database Portability & CI/CD Challenges

### 1. What Happened?

We implemented support for SQLite as an alternative to PostgreSQL. This was a critical non-functional requirement to make the application more portable. The implementation was complex and uncovered several deep-seated issues in our configuration and CI/CD pipeline, leading to a prolonged and iterative debugging process.

### 2. How Did the Process Help?

*   **Systematic RCA:** The "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" cycle was essential. Each CI failure, from Pydantic validation errors to database connection issues to `sed` command failures, required a careful analysis of logs from multiple services to pinpoint the true root cause.
*   **Revealing Hidden Flaws:** This process uncovered several latent bugs that had not been previously detected:
    1.  The `e2e_entrypoint.sh` script was not using the same conditional logic as the main `entrypoint.sh`.
    2.  The Pydantic settings validator had a logical flaw that incorrectly prioritized `.env` file values over Docker environment variables.
    3.  The CI pipeline was not cleaning up Docker volumes between runs, leading to stale database states that caused non-deterministic failures.
    4.  The `docker-compose.sqlite.yml` file was missing necessary port and volume configurations for manual testing.
*   **User Collaboration:** Direct feedback from the user, especially the observation that tests passed locally after a `docker system prune`, was the critical clue that helped diagnose the CI volume caching issue.

### 3. Outcome & New Learning

*   The application now robustly supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite, making it significantly easier to set up and deploy.
*   The CI pipeline is more reliable due to the addition of explicit cleanup steps.
*   **Key Learnings:**
    1.  **Database-Agnosticism is More Than Just SQL:** True portability requires removing all DB-specific elements, including data types (`JSONB`, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`) and connection arguments (`check_same_thread`). Custom SQLAlchemy types are an excellent pattern for this.
    2.  **Entrypoints Must Be Consistent:** All entrypoint scripts (`entrypoint.sh`, `e2e_entrypoint.sh`) that perform similar functions must be kept in sync.
    3.  **CI is Not a Clean Room:** Never assume a CI runner provides a perfectly clean environment for every run. Docker volumes, caches, and other artifacts can persist. Always add explicit cleanup steps (`docker compose down -v`) to your workflows to ensure reproducible builds.
    4.  **Configuration Loading Order Matters:** The interaction between `.env` files, Docker environment variables, and Pydantic validators is complex. The order of precedence must be carefully managed to avoid subtle and confusing bugs.

## 2025-08-22: Final Stabilization & API Contract Enforcement

### 1. What Happened?

The final push to get the E2E test suite to a 100% passing state involved fixing a series of bugs related to modals and backend data fetching. The most critical bug was in the "Edit Transaction" flow, where the feature was completely broken.

### 2. How Did the Process Help?

*   **E2E as a Truth Source:** The E2E test logs were invaluable. The `transaction-history.spec.ts` test log clearly showed that the `handleEdit` function in the frontend was receiving an incomplete `Transaction` object from the backend API, which was missing the `portfolio_id`. This immediately pinpointed the bug's origin in the backend.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Instead of trying to patch the frontend to work around the missing data, the RCA process correctly identified that the `GET /api/v1/transactions/` endpoint was violating its implicit data contract. The Pydantic schema (`schemas.Transaction`) defined the expected shape, but the endpoint was not delivering it.

### 3. Outcome & New Learning

*   The application is now fully stable with a 12/12 passing E2E test suite.
*   **API Schemas are Contracts:** This experience reinforces a critical software engineering principle: API response schemas are a contract. The backend *must* guarantee that it will return data in the shape defined by the schema. The frontend should be able to trust this contract implicitly. When this contract is broken, it leads to hard-to-debug, cascading failures in the client application. Rigorous testing of API responses against their schemas is essential.

# Watchlists

The Watchlists feature allows users to create and manage custom lists of financial assets they want to track. This feature provides a personalized view of the market, enabling users to monitor the performance of assets they are interested in without having to search for them individually.

## Creating a Watchlist

To create a new watchlist, navigate to the "Watchlists" page and click the "New" button. You will be prompted to enter a name for your watchlist. Once you've entered a name, click "Create" to save the new watchlist.

## Managing Watchlists

You can manage your watchlists from the "Watchlists" page. Use the dropdown menu to select the watchlist you want to view. You can also edit the name of a watchlist or delete it entirely using the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

## Adding and Removing Assets

To add an asset to a watchlist, select the watchlist from the dropdown menu and click the "Add Asset" button. This will open a modal where you can search for assets by name or symbol. Click the "Add" button next to the asset you want to add to your watchlist.

To remove an asset from a watchlist, simply click the "X" button next to the asset in the watchlist table.

# Feature Plan: Public Provident Fund (PPF) Tracking

**Status: üèóÔ∏è In Progress**
---
**Feature ID:** FR4.3.4
**Title:** Implement Public Provident Fund (PPF) Tracking with Automated Interest Calculation
**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my PPF account with automated interest calculations based on official rates, so I can see its true growth without manual updates and have confidence in the data.

---

## 1. Implementation Progress

*   [x] **Phase 1: Database Schema & Seeding:** The necessary database models, schemas, and migration scripts have been implemented and tested. The database is now ready to store PPF accounts, contributions, and historical interest rates.
*   [x] **Phase 2: Backend Business Logic:** Implement the dynamic valuation and interest calculation logic in `crud_holding.py`.
*   [x] **Phase 3: Frontend UI:** Implement the UI for adding and viewing PPF accounts and transactions.
*   [ ] **Phase 4: Testing:** Backend unit tests have been implemented and are passing. The E2E test for the full user flow is created but is currently failing due to a timeout issue that needs further investigation.

## 2. Objective

The initial MVP for PPF tracking relied on a user-managed `current_balance`, which is inaccurate and cumbersome. This plan details a full implementation of proper contribution tracking and automated, rule-based interest calculations. The core principle is to treat a PPF account as a standard `Asset` and contributions as `Transaction`s, ensuring they appear in the user's main transaction history for full visibility.

## 3. UI/UX Requirements

*   **Sectioned View:** PPF accounts will be displayed within the new "Government Schemes" collapsible section in the main holdings table.
*   **Holdings Table Columns:** The "Government Schemes" section will have columns relevant to PPF: Asset (e.g., "PPF Account"), Institution, Opening Date, Current Balance.
*   **User Interactions:**
    *   **Add PPF Account:** A new "PPF Account" option will be added to the "Add Asset" flow. The form will capture `Institution Name`, `Account Number`, and `Opening Date`. This will create an `Asset` of type `PPF`.
    *   **Add Contribution:** When adding a transaction for a PPF asset, the transaction type will be `CONTRIBUTION`. This will use the existing transaction modal.
    *   **Drill-Down View:** Clicking a PPF holding will open a detailed view showing all `CONTRIBUTION` transactions and all system-generated `INTEREST_CREDIT` transactions, providing a clear, auditable history of the account's growth.
    *   **Interest Rate Management (Admin):** A new UI in the "Admin Settings" area will allow an administrator to view and manage the historical PPF interest rates used in calculations.

### 3.1. User Workflow for Historical Data

To track an existing PPF account, the user follows this process:
1.  **Create the PPF Asset:** The user first creates the "PPF Account" asset with the correct opening date.
2.  **Log All Past Contributions:** The user then adds all historical contributions as individual `CONTRIBUTION` transactions with their correct dates.
3.  **Automated Calculation:** The system automatically calculates the interest for each past financial year based on the logged contributions and the stored historical interest rates. It creates the necessary read-only `INTEREST_CREDIT` transactions.

**Note:** Users cannot manually add or edit the interest. The system's automated calculation, based on user-provided contributions, is the single source of truth for interest credits.

## 4. Backend Requirements

### 4.1. Database Schema Changes

*   **`Asset` Model (`models/asset.py`):**
    *   The `Asset` model will be updated with two new nullable columns: `account_number: Optional[str]` and `opening_date: Optional[date]`. This is the most pragmatic approach to store PPF-specific data without creating a new satellite table.
*   **`TransactionType` Enum (`schemas/transaction.py`):**
    *   A new value, `CONTRIBUTION`, will be added to the `TransactionType` enum.
*   **`AssetType` Enum (`schemas/asset.py`):**
    *   A new value, `PPF`, will be added to the `AssetType` enum.
*   **New Table: `historical_interest_rates`:**
    *   A new global table will be created to store historical interest rates for various government schemes.
    *   **Columns:** `id`, `scheme_name` (e.g., "PPF"), `start_date`, `end_date`, `rate`.
    *   **Data Source:** The historical data for PPF rates will be seeded from `backend/app/db/seed_data/ppf_interest_rates.py`.

### 4.2. API Endpoints

*   **Asset Creation:** The existing `POST /api/v1/assets/` endpoint will be used. The `AssetCreate` schema will be updated to accept the new optional `account_number` and `opening_date` fields.
*   **Contribution Creation:** The existing `POST /portfolios/{id}/transactions` endpoint will be used, with `transaction_type: 'CONTRIBUTION'`.
*   **Interest Rate Management (Admin):** A new set of admin-only endpoints will be created under `/api/v1/admin/interest-rates` for full CRUD operations on the `historical_interest_rates` table.

### 4.3. Valuation Logic (`crud_holding.py`)

A new function will be implemented to calculate the PPF balance dynamically. It will fetch all `CONTRIBUTION` transactions for the PPF asset and apply interest based on the stored official rates.

*   **Phase 1 (Simplified Annual Calculation):**
    *   For each financial year (Apr 1 - Mar 31), the logic will calculate the opening balance.
    *   It will sum all contributions made during that year.
    *   Interest for the year will be calculated on the `(opening balance + total contributions)`. This is a simplified but effective initial approach.
    *   The final `current_balance` is the sum of all contributions plus all calculated annual interest amounts.
*   **Phase 2 (Accurate Monthly Calculation - Future Enhancement):**
    *   The logic will be enhanced to iterate month-by-month.
    *   For each month, it will determine the minimum balance between the 5th and the end of the month.
    *   It will look up the applicable annual interest rate for that specific month from the `historical_interest_rates` table and calculate the monthly interest on this minimum balance (`applicable_rate / 12`).
    *   The sum of all monthly interest amounts for a financial year will be credited on March 31st.
*   **Interest as Transaction (On-Demand Calculation):** The system does not use a background job. The interest calculation is triggered dynamically whenever a user's holdings are calculated (e.g., when viewing the portfolio). The logic iterates through each financial year of the PPF's life.
    *   **For Completed Financial Years:** If an `INTEREST_CREDIT` transaction for a *completed* year is missing or outdated (because a contribution was added/edited), the system will calculate and create/update it on the spot.
    *   **For the Current Financial Year:** The interest is calculated on-the-fly to determine the holding's `current_value`, but the `INTEREST_CREDIT` transaction is **not** created in the database until the financial year has concluded. This ensures the `current_value` is always up-to-date, while the transaction history remains clean and accurate.

### 4.4. Recalculation & Correction Logic

*   **Trigger for Recalculation:** The recalculation process is triggered whenever a user creates, updates, or deletes a `CONTRIBUTION` transaction.
*   **Correction Process (Smart Recalculation):**
    1.  When a contribution is modified, the system identifies the financial year of the change.
    2.  It then deletes all system-generated `INTEREST_CREDIT` transactions for that PPF asset from that financial year *onwards*. This is because a change in one year affects the opening balance of all subsequent years.
    3.  The next time holdings are calculated, the system will see the missing interest transactions and will re-calculate and create them sequentially, starting only from the first year that was invalidated. This avoids redundant calculations for unchanged years.
*   **Admin Corrections:** If an administrator corrects a historical interest rate, a background job or manual trigger should be available to re-calculate interest for all affected users and financial years.

## 5. Testing Plan

*   **Backend Unit Tests:**
    *   Write extensive tests for the new PPF interest calculation logic (Phase 1) against a known-correct spreadsheet calculation.
    *   Test the automatic creation of the `INTEREST_CREDIT` transaction at the end of a simulated financial year.
    *   Add tests for the new admin-only endpoints for managing historical interest rates.
*   **E2E Tests:**
    1. Create a PPF account.
    2. Add several contribution transactions.
    3. Verify the calculated `Current Balance` in the "Government Schemes" section is correct.
    4. Open the drill-down view and verify that both the `CONTRIBUTION` and the auto-generated `INTEREST_CREDIT` transactions are listed correctly.

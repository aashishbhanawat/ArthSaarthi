### 1. User Story

**As a** user with investments in Portfolio Management Services (PMS) or Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs),
**I want to** import my statements,
**so that** I can track these complex investments alongside my other assets.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Research common PMS/AIF statement formats from major providers in India.
*   [ ] Identify if there are any standardized formats or if each provider's statement is unique.
*   [ ] Develop a flexible parsing strategy to handle the potential variety of formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).
*   [ ] Implement a proof-of-concept parser for at least one major PMS/AIF provider.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** A research document is created summarizing the findings on PMS/AIF statement formats and their complexity.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** A new parser for at least one major PMS provider is implemented and successfully parses a sample statement in a unit test.

---

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on the core data import framework (`FR7.1.1`).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR7.1.4)`
*   This is a research-heavy task. The initial goal is to understand the complexity and feasibility before committing to a full implementation for all providers.

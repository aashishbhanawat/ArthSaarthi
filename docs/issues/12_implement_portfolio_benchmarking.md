### 1. User Story

**As a** performance-conscious investor,
**I want to** compare my portfolio's performance against a standard market benchmark (e.g., Nifty 50),
**so that** I can understand if my investment strategy is outperforming or underperforming the broader market.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Users must be able to select a benchmark index for their portfolio (e.g., Nifty 50, S&P 500).
*   [ ] The system must fetch historical price data for the selected benchmark index.
*   [ ] The analytics dashboard must display a performance comparison chart (e.g., a line chart) showing the portfolio's growth versus the benchmark's growth over time.
*   [ ] The comparison should be available for various timeframes (e.g., 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, All-time).

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am on the portfolio analytics dashboard, when I select "Nifty 50" as a benchmark, then a line chart should appear showing my portfolio's growth alongside the Nifty 50's growth for the selected period.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** If my portfolio has outperformed the benchmark over the selected period, its line on the chart should be above the benchmark's line.

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on historical valuation tracking (`FR6.7`).
*   This feature is a prerequisite for calculating advanced risk metrics like Beta and Alpha (`FR6.2`).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR6.3)`
*   This will require a reliable data source for historical index data. The UI should allow for easy selection of different benchmarks.

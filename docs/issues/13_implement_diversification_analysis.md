### 1. User Story

**As a** diligent investor,
**I want to** see a visual breakdown of my portfolio's diversification across various categories (like Sector, Geography, and Market Cap),
**so that** I can easily identify concentration risks and ensure my investments are well-balanced according to my strategy.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] The system must calculate and display portfolio allocation by asset class (this may enhance the existing dashboard chart).
*   [ ] The system must calculate and display portfolio allocation by Industry/Sector for equity holdings.
*   [ ] The system must calculate and display portfolio allocation by Geography.
*   [ ] The system must display these breakdowns using clear and interactive visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar charts).

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am on the portfolio analytics dashboard, when I view the diversification section, then I should see charts breaking down my holdings by Sector and Geography.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Hovering over a segment of a chart should display the category name and its percentage of the total portfolio.

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on having access to asset metadata (sector, geography). This may require enhancing the financial data service to fetch and store this information.

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR6.4)`
*   The implementation will need to be flexible to handle assets that may not have complete metadata.

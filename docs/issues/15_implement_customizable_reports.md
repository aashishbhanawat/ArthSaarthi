### 1. User Story

**As a** user who needs to review or share my portfolio data offline,
**I want to** generate and export various reports (like Holdings, Transactions, and Income) in PDF or CSV format,
**so that** I can perform my own analysis or share it with my financial advisor.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Implement a backend service to generate reports based on user data.
*   [ ] Support report generation in both PDF and CSV formats.
*   [ ] Create API endpoints to trigger the generation and download of specific reports.
*   [ ] Available reports should include: Holdings, Transactions, Income, and Asset Allocation.
*   [ ] The UI should provide an interface for users to select a report type and download it.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am on my portfolio dashboard, when I select "Export Holdings Report as CSV", then a CSV file containing my current holdings should be downloaded.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given I have received dividends, when I select "Export Income Report as PDF", then a PDF file summarizing my income for the period should be downloaded.

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature's sub-reports depend on the completion of their respective data tracking features (e.g., the Income report depends on `FR4.5`).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR6.6)`
*   This feature will likely require new Python libraries for PDF generation (e.g., `reportlab` or `weasyprint`).

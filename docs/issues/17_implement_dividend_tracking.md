### 1. User Story

**As a** user who receives dividends from my stock holdings,
**I want to** log these dividend payments,
**so that** I can accurately track my total returns and the income generated by my portfolio.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Users must be able to manually add a "dividend" transaction for a specific stock.
*   [ ] The dividend transaction must capture: asset ticker, total dividend amount, and payment date.
*   [ ] The system must provide an option to mark a dividend as "reinvested".
*   [ ] If a dividend is marked as "reinvested", the system should automatically create a corresponding "buy" transaction for the asset.
*   [ ] Logged dividends should be reflected in a new "Income" report or dashboard section.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I have stock holdings, when I add a cash dividend transaction, then the total dividend amount should be reflected in my income report and should not affect my holdings.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given I add a "reinvested" dividend, when I view my transactions, then a new "buy" transaction should be created for the corresponding asset, increasing my total holdings.

---

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on the core transaction management system (`FR4.4`).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR4.5)`
*   This is the first issue for the "Income & Corporate Actions" epic. The initial implementation will focus on manual entry. Automatic dividend tracking can be a future enhancement under `FR4.6`.

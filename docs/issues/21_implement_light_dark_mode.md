### 1. User Story

**As a** frequent user of the application,
**I want to** be able to switch between a light and a dark theme,
**so that** I can reduce eye strain during late-night sessions and match my operating system's appearance settings.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Implement a theme switcher control in the application's UI (e.g., in the settings page or header).
*   [ ] The application should support a "System" setting that automatically applies the light or dark theme based on the user's OS preference (`prefers-color-scheme`).
*   [ ] The user's selected theme preference (Light, Dark, or System) must be saved and persist across sessions.
*   [ ] All UI components, including charts, tables, forms, and text, must adapt correctly to the selected theme.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am on any page, when I select "Dark Mode" from the theme switcher, then the entire UI should immediately switch to a dark color palette.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given my theme is set to "Dark Mode", when I log out and log back in, then the application should still be in "Dark Mode".
*   [ ] **Scenario 3:** Given my OS is set to dark mode and my app theme is set to "System", when I open the application, then it should automatically render in dark mode.

---

### 4. Dependencies

*   None. This is primarily a frontend-focused task.

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR11.1)`
*   This is the first issue for the "User Experience" epic. A good implementation approach would be to use CSS custom properties (variables) for all colors to allow for easy toggling.

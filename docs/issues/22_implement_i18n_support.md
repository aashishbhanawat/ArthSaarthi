### 1. User Story

**As a** non-English speaking user,
**I want to** view the application in my native language,
**so that** I can understand and use it more effectively.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Refactor all hardcoded UI strings into a resource file format (e.g., JSON, YAML).
*   [ ] Implement a language-switching mechanism in the UI.
*   [ ] The user's language preference should be saved and persist across sessions.
*   [ ] The application should default to a language based on the browser's `Accept-Language` header if no preference is set.
*   [ ] Provide an initial translation file for at least one other language besides English (e.g., Hindi) as a proof of concept.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given the application UI is in English, when I select "Hindi" from the language switcher, then all UI text should change to Hindi.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given my language preference is set to "Hindi", when I log out and log back in, then the application should still be in Hindi.
*   [ ] **Scenario 3:** Given my browser's primary language is set to Hindi and I am a new user, when I first open the application, then it should default to the Hindi language.

---

### 4. Dependencies

*   None. This is primarily a frontend-focused task.

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR11.2)`
*   This is a foundational feature for making the application accessible to a global audience. It will likely require a library like `i18next` or `react-i18next` on the frontend.

### 1. User Story

**As a** user who is unsure about my investment style,
**I want to** answer a guided questionnaire about my financial situation and risk tolerance,
**so that** the system can help me determine my appropriate risk profile.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Create a new page or section for the Risk Profile Questionnaire.
*   [ ] The questionnaire must include a series of multiple-choice questions covering topics like investment horizon, risk tolerance, financial stability, and investment knowledge.
*   [ ] The system must store the user's answers securely in the database.
*   [ ] Users should be able to retake the questionnaire at any time to update their profile.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am a new user, when I navigate to the "Risk Profile" section, then I should be presented with the questionnaire.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given I have completed and submitted the questionnaire, when I revisit the page, then I should see my previously submitted answers.

### 4. Dependencies

*   This is a foundational feature for the Risk Profile Management epic and has no dependencies. It is a prerequisite for `FR12.2` (Risk Score Calculation).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR12.1)`
*   This is the first issue for the "Risk Profile Management" epic. The focus is on capturing user input. A subsequent issue will cover the logic for calculating a risk score from these answers.

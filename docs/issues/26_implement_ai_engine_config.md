### 1. User Story

**As a** user,
**I want to** securely connect the application to my own AI provider API key (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI),
**so that** I can leverage AI-powered features for my portfolio analysis.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Create a new settings page or section for "AI Configuration".
*   [ ] Users must be able to select an AI provider from a dropdown list (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI).
*   [ ] Users must be able to enter and save their API key for the selected provider.
*   [ ] The API key must be stored securely (e.g., encrypted in the database).
*   [ ] Implement a backend service/client to interact with the selected AI provider's API using the stored key.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am in the AI settings, when I enter a valid API key for a provider and save, then the system should confirm that the connection is successful (e.g., by making a simple test API call).
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given I have saved an invalid API key, when the system tries to use it, then it should handle the error gracefully and inform me that the key is invalid or the connection failed.

### 4. Dependencies

*   None. This is the foundational feature for the AI-Powered Insights epic.

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR10.1)`
*   This is the first issue for the "AI-Powered Insights" epic. Security of the user-provided API key is paramount. The implementation must ensure the key is encrypted at rest.

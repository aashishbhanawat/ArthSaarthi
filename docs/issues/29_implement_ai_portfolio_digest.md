### 1. User Story

**As a** busy investor,
**I want to** receive a periodic, AI-generated digest summarizing my portfolio's performance and key events,
**so that** I can stay informed about my investments and relevant market news with minimal effort.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Implement a backend function that gathers relevant data for a user's portfolio over a specific period (e.g., last week). Data should include overall performance, best/worst performers, and major news related to their holdings.
*   [ ] Develop a prompt for the AI model that instructs it to generate a concise, narrative summary based on the provided data.
*   [ ] The system should allow users to generate this digest on-demand for different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly).
*   [ ] Create a new UI component or page to display the generated portfolio digest.
*   [ ] The digest should be presented in a clear, easy-to-read format.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I have a portfolio with various assets, when I request a "Weekly Digest", then the system should generate and display a text summary highlighting my portfolio's percentage change, top gainer, and top loser for the past week.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** If one of my stocks had a major news event (e.g., earnings announcement), the weekly digest should mention it.

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on the completion of the AI Engine Configuration (`FR10.1`, Issue #26).
*   It would benefit from the Market News Feed (`FR8.2`) for integrating relevant news.

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR10.6)`
*   This feature focuses on using AI for data synthesis and natural language generation, turning raw numbers and data points into an easy-to-understand narrative for the user.

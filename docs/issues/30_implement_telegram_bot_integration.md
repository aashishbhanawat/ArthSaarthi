### 1. User Story

**As a** user who prefers instant updates,
**I want to** connect my ArthSaarthi account to a Telegram bot,
**so that** I can receive all my portfolio alerts and notifications directly within Telegram.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Create a new settings page for "Notification Channels".
*   [ ] On this page, generate a unique, one-time-use code for the user to link their account.
*   [ ] Implement a Telegram bot that listens for these unique codes.
*   [ ] When a user sends their unique code to the bot, the system must securely associate their Telegram Chat ID with their user account.
*   [ ] Implement a backend service capable of sending a message to a specific user via their linked Telegram Chat ID.
*   [ ] The settings page should show the status of the connection (e.g., "Connected" or "Not Connected").

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am on the Notification Channels page, when I send the provided unique code to the official Telegram bot, then the settings page should update to show a "Connected" status.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given my account is connected, when I click a "Send Test Notification" button, then I should receive a test message from the bot in my Telegram app.

---

### 4. Dependencies

*   This is a foundational feature for the Notifications & Alerts epic and is a prerequisite for `FR9.1` and `FR9.2`.

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR9.3)`
*   This will require creating a new bot via Telegram's BotFather and securely managing the bot's API token. A library like `python-telegram-bot` will be needed.

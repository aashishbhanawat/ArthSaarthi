### 1. User Story

**As an** active investor,
**I want to** set price alerts for specific assets in my portfolio or watchlist,
**so that** I can be notified immediately when an asset reaches a target price, enabling me to make timely decisions.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Users must be able to create a new price alert from an asset's detail page or watchlist.
*   [ ] An alert must capture: the asset ticker, a condition (e.g., "is above", "is below"), and a price threshold.
*   [ ] Implement a background job that periodically checks all active price alerts against the latest market prices.
*   [ ] When an alert's condition is met, the system must trigger a notification to the user via their configured delivery channel (e.g., Telegram).
*   [ ] Once an alert is triggered, it should be automatically disabled or deleted to prevent repeated notifications for the same event.
*   [ ] Users must be able to view, manage, and delete their active alerts in a dedicated "Alerts" section.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I have set an alert for "STOCK_A" to notify me if the price goes above $150, when the market price of "STOCK_A" reaches $151, then I should receive a notification via Telegram.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** Given the alert in Scenario 1 has been triggered, when the price of "STOCK_A" continues to rise to $152, then I should not receive another notification.
*   [ ] **Scenario 3:** I should be able to see my pending alert for "STOCK_A" in my "Alerts" dashboard and have the option to delete it before it triggers.

---

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on the completion of a notification delivery channel, such as Telegram Bot Integration (`FR9.3`, Issue #30).
*   It also depends on the real-time price data integration (`FR5.1`).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR9.1)`
*   This will require a robust background task scheduler (like `apscheduler`) to run frequently without impacting application performance.

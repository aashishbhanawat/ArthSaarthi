### 1. User Story

**As an** investor doing research,
**I want to** view a detailed page for any asset,
**so that** I can find all relevant information like historical performance, key metrics, and related news in one place.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] Create a new dynamic route and page for individual assets (e.g., `/assets/{ticker}`).
*   [ ] The page must display an interactive historical price chart for the asset with selectable timeframes (e.g., 1M, 6M, 1Y, All).
*   [ ] The page must display key financial metrics for the asset (e.g., Market Cap, P/E Ratio, Dividend Yield, 52-week high/low).
*   [ ] The page must display a brief description of the company or fund.
*   [ ] The page must include a feed of recent news articles specifically related to that asset.

---

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] **Scenario 1:** Given I am on my dashboard, when I click on an asset's name in my holdings or watchlist, then I should be navigated to its dedicated detail page.
*   [ ] **Scenario 2:** On the asset detail page, I should see a price chart, a summary of key metrics, and a list of recent news articles for that asset.

### 4. Dependencies

*   This feature depends on the financial data API integration (`FR5.1`) to provide detailed metrics and historical prices.
*   The news component depends on the Market News Feed feature (`FR8.2`, Issue #33).

---

### 5. Additional Context

*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR8.3)`
*   This feature completes the "Market Insights & Research" epic. It will be a data-intensive page, so efficient data fetching and caching strategies will be important for performance.

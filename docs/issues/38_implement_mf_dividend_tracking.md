### 1. User Story

**As a** mutual fund investor,
**I want to** log dividend payouts (IDCW - Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal),
**so that** I can accurately track my total returns and the income generated by my portfolio.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

*   [ ] When a user selects "Mutual Fund" as the asset type in the transaction form, the "Type" dropdown will be enhanced to include a "Dividend" option.
*   [ ] When "Dividend" is selected, the form will hide the "Quantity" and "Price" fields and show a "Total Dividend Amount" field and a "Payment Date" field.
*   [ ] An option for "Reinvested?" will be included. If checked, the frontend will construct a `BUY` transaction payload instead of a `DIVIDEND` one, using the dividend amount to calculate the quantity and NAV.

### 3. Additional Context
*   **Requirement ID:** `(FR4.5.1)`

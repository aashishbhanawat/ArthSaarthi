## 1. Project Overview

This document marks the successful completion and stabilization of the second pilot release for the Personal Portfolio Management System (PMS). The application is a full-stack web platform designed to help users manage their personal investment portfolios. It is built with a Python/FastAPI backend, a TypeScript/React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker for consistent and reliable deployment.

The project was developed following a rigorous, AI-assisted Agile SDLC, with a strong emphasis on automated testing, comprehensive documentation, and iterative feature implementation.

## 2. Final Status

*   **Overall Status:** **Complete & Stable**
*   **Backend Test Suite:** **100% Passing** (71/71 tests)
*   **Backend Test Suite:** **100% Passing** (74/74 tests)
*   **E2E Test Suite:** **100% Passing** (9/9 tests)

All planned MVP features have been implemented and validated through a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The application is stable and ready for pilot deployment or the next phase of development.

## 3. Key Features Implemented

*   **Secure Authentication:** Initial admin setup, JWT-based login/logout, and automatic session termination on token expiration.
*   **Comprehensive User Management:** Admin-only dashboard for full CRUD operations on all users.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard:** Consolidated view of total portfolio value, realized/unrealized P/L, top daily market movers, and interactive charts for portfolio history and asset allocation.
*   **Advanced Portfolio Analytics:** Calculation and display of **XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)** and **Sharpe Ratio** at both the portfolio and individual asset level.
*   **Full Portfolio & Transaction Management:**
    *   Full CRUD functionality for portfolios and transactions.
    *   A redesigned portfolio page showing a consolidated holdings view with sorting.
    *   A **Holdings Drill-Down View** to inspect the specific transactions that constitute a current holding.
*   **Automated Data Import:** A full-stack feature with a complete backend workflow for uploading, parsing, previewing, and committing transaction data from CSV files. The MVP frontend is implemented and the entire flow is validated by a stable E2E test.

## 4. How to Run the Application

The application is fully containerized. Please refer to the main **README.md** for detailed instructions on environment setup and running the application using Docker Compose.

### Key Commands

*   **Start the Application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build db backend frontend
    ```
*   **Run Backend Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test
    ```
*   **Run Frontend Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm frontend npm test
    ```
*   **Run E2E Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from e2e-tests db redis backend frontend e2e-tests
    ```

## 6. Known Issues & Technical Debt

*   **External API Dependency in E2E Tests:** The E2E tests have a dependency on the live `yfinance` API for the "create new asset" flow. This has been partially mitigated by adding mock data for specific test tickers (`XIRRTEST`), but a broader dependency remains. For future hardening, this should be fully mocked.
*   **Limited Mock Financial Data:** The mock `FinancialDataService` only contains data for a few specific tickers. This may need to be expanded for more comprehensive manual testing.

## 7. Recommended Next Steps

The application is in a strong position for future development. With the core portfolio management and analytics features now stable, the following are recommended next steps based on the product backlog:

1.  **Multi-Currency Support:** Enhance the application to support multiple currencies, including currency conversion for portfolio valuation.
2.  **Corporate Actions:** Implement functionality to handle corporate actions like stock splits, dividends, and mergers.
3.  **Advanced Reporting:** Create a dedicated reporting page with customizable charts and data exports.

This concludes the handoff for the second pilot release. The project is stable, well-documented, and ready for the next phase.

# Project Handoff Summary: Personal Portfolio Management System

**Date:** 2025-07-21

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Goal:** To build a full-stack, containerized Personal Portfolio Management System (PMS) that allows users to manage their investment portfolios.
*   **Current Status:** The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is **complete and stable**. The application has been through a rigorous stabilization phase, and all core features are functional. The UI is consistent, and the backend is fully tested.
*   **Key Implemented Features:**
    *   **Authentication:** Secure initial admin setup, user login/logout, and JWT-based session management.
    *   **User Management:** A dedicated, admin-only dashboard for performing CRUD operations on all users.
    *   **Portfolio & Transaction Management:** A stable and fully tested set of backend APIs for creating, reading, and deleting portfolios and transactions, scoped to the authenticated user.
    *   **Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard that displays a summary of the user's total portfolio value, powered by a backend endpoint.

## 2. Technical Architecture

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI
    *   **Frontend:** JavaScript with React and Vite
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL
    *   **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose

*   **Directory Structure:** The project follows a standard monorepo structure with separate `backend/` and `frontend/` directories. Key subdirectories include:
    *   `backend/app/`: Contains the core FastAPI application, organized by `api` (endpoints), `crud` (database logic), `models` (SQLAlchemy), and `schemas` (Pydantic).
    *   `frontend/src/`: Contains the React application, organized by `pages`, `components`, `hooks`, `context`, and `services`.
    *   `docs/`: Contains all project documentation, including this handoff, bug reports, and workflow history.

*   **Key Architectural Patterns:**
    *   **Containerization:** The entire application is orchestrated via `docker-compose.yml`, ensuring a consistent development environment.
    *   **Backend Design:** The backend follows a clean, layered architecture. FastAPI is used for routing, Pydantic for data validation, and SQLAlchemy for ORM interaction. A repository pattern is implemented in the `crud` layer.
    *   **Frontend Design:** The frontend uses React Query for server state management, React Context for global UI state (e.g., authentication), and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Setup & Running

1.  **Configure Environment:** Create a `backend/.env` file (copy from `backend/.env.example`). The defaults are suitable for local development. No frontend `.env` is needed due to the Vite proxy.
2.  **Build and Run:** From the project root, run the following command to start the application services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build db backend frontend
    ```
3.  **Access Services:**
    *   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
    *   **Backend API Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Running Tests

*   **Backend Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test
    ```
*   **Frontend Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm frontend npm test
    ```

## 4. Development Process & Key Learnings

This project was developed using a rigorous, AI-assisted workflow that evolved significantly over the project's lifecycle. The final, stable process is documented in detail in `docs/testing_strategy.md` and is crucial for any future development.

### Core Workflow: "Analyze -> Report -> Fix"

When a bug is discovered, we do not immediately attempt a fix. Instead, we follow a disciplined process:
1.  **Analyze:** Perform a rigorous root cause analysis (RCA) by examining the full stack trace and validating all dependencies involved in the error.
2.  **Report:** File a formal, de-duplicated bug report in `docs/bug_reports.md`.
3.  **Fix:** Request a targeted fix for the identified root cause.

### Key Learnings & Process Imperatives

Our development history revealed several critical patterns that this workflow is designed to prevent. Any new developer must be aware of these historical risks:

1.  **Risk: Configuration & Setup Errors.**
    *   **History:** A significant number of critical bugs were caused by missing dependencies, incorrect `.env` variables, or misconfigured build tools (e.g., the missing Tailwind CSS configuration).
    *   **Mitigation:** Our workflow now mandates a "foundation-first" approach. Before major work, we verify the build system and environment configuration.

2.  **Risk: Integration Mismatches.**
    *   **History:** The most common source of application-breaking bugs was a mismatch between the frontend and backend contracts (e.g., incorrect API URLs, mismatched data types like `float` vs. `Decimal`, inconsistent `localStorage` keys).
    *   **Mitigation:** The RCA process now requires validating the "contract" between components (e.g., checking the backend schema before fixing a frontend data handling issue).

3.  **Risk: Stale AI Context.**
    *   **History:** The AI assistant would occasionally work with outdated file information, leading to incorrect suggestions.
    *   **Mitigation:** The developer is the **source of truth**. The established process requires providing the AI with the latest file content to resynchronize its context when necessary.

## 5. Known Architectural Risks

*   **No Database Migration Tool:** The project currently uses SQLAlchemy's `create_all` to initialize the schema. This is not suitable for production and means that any change to a `models.py` file requires a full database reset (`docker-compose down -v`). Implementing a migration tool like **Alembic** is the highest-priority architectural improvement needed.

## 6. Next Steps

The application is stable and ready for further development. Potential next steps include:

1.  **Implement Database Migrations:** Introduce Alembic to manage schema changes gracefully.
2.  **Data Visualization:** Enhance the dashboard with charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to visualize portfolio allocation and performance history.
3.  **End-to-End Testing:** Implement a suite of E2E tests using a framework like Cypress or Playwright to automate full user-flow verification.
4.  **Feature Enhancement:** Add more advanced features, such as detailed performance analytics, dividend tracking, or multi-currency support.

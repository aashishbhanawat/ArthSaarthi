## 1. Project Overview

This document marks the successful completion and stabilization of the Personal Portfolio Management System (PMS) pilot release. The application is a full-stack web platform designed to help users manage their personal investment portfolios. It is built with a Python/FastAPI backend, a TypeScript/React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker for consistent and reliable deployment.

The project was developed following a rigorous, AI-assisted Agile SDLC, with a strong emphasis on automated testing, comprehensive documentation, and iterative feature implementation.

## 2. Final Status

*   **Overall Status:** **Complete & Stable**
*   **Backend Test Suite:** **100% Passing** (67/67 tests)
*   **Frontend Test Suite:** **100% Passing** (17/17 suites)
*   **E2E Test Suite:** **100% Passing** (7/7 tests)

All planned MVP features have been implemented and validated through a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The application is stable and ready for pilot deployment or the next phase of development.

## 3. Key Features Implemented

*   **Secure Authentication:** Initial admin setup, JWT-based login/logout, and automatic session termination on token expiration.
*   **Comprehensive User Management:** Admin-only dashboard for full CRUD operations on all users.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard:** Consolidated view of total portfolio value, realized/unrealized P/L, top daily market movers, and interactive charts for portfolio history and asset allocation.
*   **Advanced Portfolio Analytics:** Calculation and display of **XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)** and **Sharpe Ratio**.
*   **Portfolio & Transaction Management:** Users can create multiple portfolios and manually add transactions for Stocks, ETFs, and Mutual Funds.
*   **Full Portfolio & Transaction Tracking:** Create and manage multiple portfolios, add transactions, and perform on-the-fly asset creation for unlisted tickers.
*   **Business Logic Validation:** The system prevents invalid transactions, such as selling more assets than are held on a given date.
*   **Automated Data Import:** A full-stack feature with a complete backend workflow for uploading, parsing, previewing, and committing transaction data from CSV files. The MVP frontend is implemented and the entire flow is validated by a stable E2E test.

## 4. How to Run the Application

The application is fully containerized. Please refer to the main **README.md** for detailed instructions on environment setup and running the application using Docker Compose.

### Key Commands

*   **Start the Application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build db backend frontend
    ```
*   **Run Backend Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test
    ```
*   **Run Frontend Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm frontend npm test
    ```
*   **Run E2E Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from e2e-tests db redis backend frontend e2e-tests
    ```

## 5. Codebase & Documentation

*   **Source Code:** The full source code is available in the `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.
*   **System Architecture:** See docs/architecture.md.
*   **Feature Plans:** All implemented features have detailed plans in docs/features/.
*   **Bug Reports:** A comprehensive log of all bugs discovered and fixed is available in docs/bug_reports.md.
*   **Development History:** A detailed, chronological log of the AI-assisted development process is available in docs/workflow_history.md.
*   **Troubleshooting:** For common issues, please refer to the docs/troubleshooting.md.
*   **Debugging:** For instructions on enabling dynamic debug logs, see the docs/debugging_guide.md.

## 6. Known Issues & Technical Debt

*   **External API Dependency in E2E Tests:** The E2E tests have a dependency on the live `yfinance` API for the "create new asset" flow. For future hardening, this should be mocked to create a more hermetic test environment. (See Bug ID: `2025-07-30-30`).
*   **Limited Mock Financial Data:** The mock `FinancialDataService` only contains data for a few specific tickers. This may need to be expanded for more comprehensive manual testing.

## 7. Recommended Next Steps

The application is in a strong position for future development. The following are recommended next steps based on the product backlog:

1.  **UI/UX for Data Import:** Implement the frontend components for the "Automated Data Import" feature, allowing users to upload files and see the preview/commit UI.
2.  **Expand Data Import Parsers:** Add specific parsers for other common broker statements (e.g., ICICI) and Mutual Fund CAS statements.
3.  **Implement User Profile Management (FR1.5):** Allow users to change their password and update their profile information.
4.  **Refactor Financial Data Service:** Implement the planned Strategy Pattern to allow for multiple financial data providers.

This concludes the handoff for the pilot release. The project is stable, well-documented, and ready for the next phase.

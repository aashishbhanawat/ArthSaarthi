## 1. Project Overview

This document provides a status update for **ArthSaarthi**. The application is a full-stack web platform designed to help users manage their personal investment portfolios. It is built with a Python/FastAPI backend and a TypeScript/React frontend. The application now supports both **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite** as database backends, making it highly portable and easy to deploy in various environments, from full Docker setups to single-file native executables.

The project was developed following a rigorous, AI-assisted Agile SDLC, with a strong emphasis on automated testing, comprehensive documentation, and iterative feature implementation.

## 2. Final Status

*   **Overall Status:** **Stable**
*   **Backend Tests:** **100% Passing**
*   **Frontend Tests:** **100% Passing**
*   **E2E Tests:** **12/12 Passing**

All planned features for the current release cycle have been implemented and validated through a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The application is stable and ready for the next phase of development.

## 3. Key Features Implemented

*   **Secure Authentication:** Initial admin setup, JWT-based login/logout, and automatic session termination on token expiration.
*   **Comprehensive User Management:** Admin-only dashboard for full CRUD operations on all users.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard:** Consolidated view of total portfolio value, realized/unrealized P/L, top daily market movers, and interactive charts for portfolio history and asset allocation.
*   **Advanced Portfolio Analytics:** Calculation and display of **XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)** and **Sharpe Ratio** at both the portfolio and individual asset level.
*   **Full Portfolio & Transaction Management:**
    *   Full CRUD functionality for portfolios and transactions.
    *   A redesigned portfolio page showing a consolidated holdings view with sorting.
    *   A dedicated, filterable **Transaction History** page with edit and delete capabilities.
    *   A **Holdings Drill-Down View** to inspect the specific transactions that constitute a current holding.
*   **Automated Data Import (Phase 2):**
    *   A full-stack feature with a workflow for uploading, parsing, previewing, and committing transaction data from CSV files.
    *   A robust parser strategy that supports generic CSVs, Zerodha Tradebooks, and ICICI Direct Tradebooks.
    *   An advanced frontend UI with categorized previews, selective transaction committing, and on-the-fly asset alias mapping for unrecognized symbols.
    *   Intelligent sorting of transactions to ensure data integrity regardless of source file order.
*   **Database Portability (SQLite Support):**
    *   The application backend has been refactored to be database-agnostic, officially supporting both PostgreSQL and SQLite.
    *   This significantly enhances portability, simplifying deployment for users who prefer not to manage a separate PostgreSQL server.
*   **Pluggable Caching Layer:**
    *   The hard dependency on Redis has been removed and replaced with a flexible caching abstraction.
    *   The application now supports both Redis (default for Docker) and a file-based `diskcache` (default for SQLite/local deployments), configured via a `CACHE_TYPE` environment variable.

## 4. Development Process & CI/CD

To improve code quality and ensure stability, a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and linting process have been established.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** A GitHub Actions workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It automatically runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. The pipeline performs the following checks:
    *   **Linting:** Runs `ruff` on the backend and `eslint` on the frontend to enforce code style and catch errors.
    *   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Executes the full Pytest suite for the backend and the Jest/RTL suite for the frontend.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Runs the full Playwright E2E test suite in an isolated Docker environment.

*   **Linting Process:**
    *   **Backend:** The backend uses `ruff` for both linting and formatting. The configuration is in `backend/pyproject.toml`.
    *   **Frontend:** The frontend uses `ESLint` with a standard configuration for React/TypeScript projects (`frontend/.eslintrc.cjs`). A `lint` script is available in `frontend/package.json` to run the linter locally: `npm run lint`.

*   **Local Test Runner:** A new script, `./run_local_tests.sh`, has been created to run the entire test and linting suite in a local, non-Docker environment. This is the recommended way to validate changes locally before committing.

**Instructions for AI Assistants:**
Future development by AI assistants **must** adhere to these processes. All code changes must pass the linting checks and all test suites before being submitted. Any new feature should be accompanied by corresponding tests.

## 5. How to Run the Application

The application is fully containerized. Please refer to the main **README.md** for detailed instructions on environment setup and running the application using Docker Compose.

### Key Commands

The application can be run with either PostgreSQL (default) or SQLite.

*   **Start with PostgreSQL (Default):**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
*   **Start with SQLite:**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up --build
    ```

*   **Start in Desktop Mode (for manual testing):**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.desktop.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up --build
    ```

*   **Run Backend Tests (PostgreSQL):**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test
    ```
*   **Run Backend Tests (SQLite):**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.sqlite.yml run --rm test-sqlite
    ```

*   **Run Frontend Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm frontend npm test
    ```

*   **Run E2E Tests (PostgreSQL):**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
    ```
*   **Run E2E Tests (SQLite):**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.sqlite.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
    ```

## 6. Codebase & Documentation

*   **Source Code:** The full source code is available in the `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.
*   **System Architecture:** See docs/architecture.md.
*   **Feature Plans:** All implemented features have detailed plans in docs/features/.
*   **Bug Reports:** A comprehensive log of all bugs discovered and fixed is available in docs/bug_reports.md.
*   **Development History:** A detailed, chronological log of the AI-assisted development process is available in docs/workflow_history.md.
*   **Troubleshooting:** For common issues, please refer to the docs/troubleshooting.md.
*   **Debugging:** For instructions on enabling dynamic debug logs, see the docs/debugging_guide.md.

---

## 7. Known Issues & Next Steps

*   **External API Dependency in E2E Tests:** The E2E tests have a dependency on the live `yfinance` API for the "create new asset" flow. This has been partially mitigated by adding mock data for specific test tickers, but a broader dependency remains. For future hardening, this should be fully mocked.
*   **Limited Mock Financial Data:** The mock `FinancialDataService` only contains data for a few specific tickers. This may need to be expanded for more comprehensive manual testing.

## 8. Recommended Next Steps

The application is in a strong position for future development. With the core portfolio management and data import features now stable, the following are recommended next steps based on the product backlog:

1.  **Advanced Asset Support:** Add support for other asset classes like Fixed Deposits (FDs), Public Provident Fund (PPF), and Bonds.
2.  **Corporate Actions:** Implement functionality to handle corporate actions like stock splits, dividends, and mergers.
3.  **Risk Profile Management:** Implement the risk questionnaire and portfolio alignment dashboard.

This concludes the handoff for the data import release. The project is stable, well-documented, and ready for the next phase.

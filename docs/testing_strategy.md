# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Personal Portfolio Management System to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability. We employ a multi-layered testing approach.

## 1. Backend Testing

The backend is tested using the `pytest` framework along with `httpx` for asynchronous API requests.

### a. Backend Unit Tests

*   **Objective:** Verify that individual, isolated pieces of the backend code work correctly.
*   **Location:** `backend/app/tests/`
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Core Logic:** Test utility functions like password hashing and verification (`core/security.py`).
    *   **Schemas:** Test Pydantic model validators, especially for complex rules like password strength (`schemas/user.py`).

### b. Backend Integration Tests

*   **Objective:** Verify that different parts of the backend work together as expected, focusing on API endpoints and their interaction with a test database.
*   **Location:** `backend/app/tests/api/`
*   **Scope:**
    *   **API Endpoints:** Test each endpoint for correct responses with valid data (2xx status codes), invalid client input (4xx status codes), and server errors (5xx status codes).
    *   **Database Interaction:** Ensure that API calls result in the correct state changes in the database (e.g., creating a user, fetching data).

## 2. Frontend Testing

Frontend testing will be implemented using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

### a. Frontend Unit Tests

*   **Objective:** Test individual React components in isolation.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Verify that components render correctly with different props.
    *   Test component state changes and logic.

### b. Frontend Integration Tests

*   **Objective:** Test how multiple components work together.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Simulate user interactions (e.g., filling out a form, clicking buttons).
    *   Mock API calls to verify that components handle success, error, and loading states correctly.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests will be implemented using a framework like **Cypress** or **Playwright**.

*   **Objective:** Simulate a real user's journey through the live application, interacting with both the frontend and the real backend.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Test critical user flows, such as user registration, login, and core feature interactions.

# Workflow & AI Interaction History

This document serves as a chronological log of the development process for this project, specifically detailing the interactions with the GenAI code assistant.

Its purpose is to build an experience history that can be used as a reference for future projects, to onboard new team members, or to showcase GenAI-assisted development skills. Each entry captures a specific development task, the prompts used, the AI's output, and the final outcome.

## 2024-07-17: Backend for User Management

*   **Task Description:** Implement the backend functionality for the User Management feature, allowing an administrator to perform CRUD operations on users.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Generation:** "Please generate all the necessary backend code for the User Management feature based on our plan."
    2.  **Code Review & Refinement:** The AI's initial output was reviewed. Several iterative prompts were used to correct and complete the code, such as adding the `UserUpdate` schema and implementing missing CRUD functions (`update_user`, `remove`) in `crud_user.py`.
    3.  **Test Generation:** "Can you generate unit tests for the backend User Management API endpoints I added?"
    4.  **Iterative Debugging:** A series of prompts were used to debug the test suite. Each prompt provided the exact `pytest` error log (e.g., `NameError`, `AttributeError`, `TypeError`), allowing the AI to provide a targeted fix for each issue. This included correcting invalid test passwords, fixing import paths, and aligning function calls with their definitions.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py`: Created CRUD endpoints for users. Added `/me` endpoint for individual user profiles.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_user.py`: Implemented `get_users`, `get_user`, `update_user`, and `remove` functions.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/user.py`: Added `UserUpdate` schema and OpenAPI examples.
    *   `backend/app/core/dependencies.py`: Added `get_current_admin_user` dependency to protect admin routes.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_users_admin.py`: Added a comprehensive test suite for all user management endpoints.
    *   `backend/app/tests/utils/user.py`: Updated `create_random_user` to generate valid passwords.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_users.py`: Corrected tests to align with new endpoint logic.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `docker-compose run --rm test`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The backend for the User Management feature is complete, fully tested, and all 23 tests are passing.
    - A new mitigation plan for AI interaction was documented in `docs/testing_strategy.md` to improve future development workflows.

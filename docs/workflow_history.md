## 2025-08-06: Full-Stack Test Suite Stabilization

*   **Task Description:** A final, intensive effort to stabilize all test suites (frontend, backend, and E2E) after implementing the initial set of features requested by the pilot users. This involved debugging complex race conditions, fixing incorrect test logic, and resolving multiple environment configuration issues.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The entire process was driven by analyzing failing test logs from `pytest`, `npm test`, and `playwright`. For each failure, the full log was provided to the AI to diagnose the root cause.
    2.  **Bug Triage & Fixing:** For each distinct class of error, the "report a bug" and "apply the fix" prompts were used to systematically document and resolve bugs. This included:
        *   **E2E Startup Race Condition:** The AI diagnosed that the `e2e-tests` container was starting before the `backend` was ready. The fix was to implement a `global.setup.ts` file with a retry loop.
        *   **E2E Test State Pollution:** The AI identified that state was leaking between serially executed test files. The `global.setup.ts` also fixed this by performing a single, global database reset.
        *   **Backend Analytics Crash:** The AI diagnosed that `NaN` or `Infinity` values from analytics calculations were crashing the JSON serializer and provided a fix to handle these edge cases.
        *   **Frontend Test Failures:** The AI identified and fixed numerous unit test failures caused by incorrect mocks and outdated assertions after component refactors.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `e2e/global.setup.ts`: **New** file to handle global E2E test setup, including waiting for the backend and resetting the database.
    *   `e2e/playwright.config.ts`: Updated to use the new `global.setup.ts` file.

## 2025-08-06: Implement Edit/Delete Transactions & Context-Sensitive Help

*   **Task Description:** Implemented two high-priority features based on pilot feedback: full-stack implementation for editing/deleting transactions and a frontend enhancement for context-sensitive help. Both implementations involved significant, iterative debugging of their respective test suites.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions (Backend - Edit/Delete):**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** Generated the `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints in `transactions.py` and corresponding tests in `test_portfolios_transactions.py`.
    2.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The backend test suite failed with a cascade of errors. The "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" workflow was used to resolve them:
        *   `TypeError` due to incorrect test helper function signatures (`create_test_transaction`).
        *   `404 Not Found` errors due to tests calling incorrect, non-nested API URLs.
        *   `AssertionError` due to the update endpoint returning stale data, which was fixed by adding `db.refresh()`.
        *   A final `AssertionError` was traced to an empty `TransactionUpdate` Pydantic schema, which was then correctly defined.
        *   A final `NameError` on startup was fixed by moving a misplaced import in `schemas/transaction.py`.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions (Frontend - Edit/Delete & Help):**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** Generated the `HelpLink.tsx` component and integrated it into `DashboardPage.tsx`. Refactored `TransactionFormModal.tsx` to handle an "edit" mode and added Edit/Delete buttons to `TransactionList.tsx`.

## 2025-08-07: Implement & Stabilize Asset-Level XIRR Analytics

*   **Task Description:** Implement the "Asset-Level XIRR Analytics" feature (FR6.1) and a corresponding E2E test. This task involved a highly iterative and complex debugging cycle to stabilize the E2E test and fix several regressions that were uncovered in the process.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the backend mock data in `financial_data_service.py` and the new E2E test file `analytics.spec.ts`.
    2.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The E2E test failed with a cascade of different errors. The "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" workflow was used at each step to diagnose the root cause from the test logs.
    3.  **Bug Triage & Fixing:** This process uncovered and fixed several critical issues:
        *   **E2E Test Failure (Backend):** The test failed because the backend's asset creation endpoint was trying to validate a mock ticker against a live service. This was fixed by adding mock data to the `get_asset_details` method in the `FinancialDataService`.
        *   **E2E Test Failure (Frontend):** The test failed because the `HoldingDetailModal` was not accessible (missing `role="dialog"`), which was fixed by adding the correct accessibility attributes.
        *   **Major Regressions:** Manual testing revealed that a series of previous fixes for the modal UI flow had been lost. This required a consolidated effort to re-apply all the correct state management logic to `PortfolioDetailPage.tsx` and to fix an incorrect API path in `portfolioApi.ts`.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/services/financial_data_service.py`: **Updated** with mock data for the E2E test asset.
    *   `e2e/tests/analytics.spec.ts`: **Updated** with a new test case for asset-level XIRR.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/HoldingDetailModal.tsx`: **Updated** with accessibility attributes to make it discoverable by the test runner.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/Portfolio/PortfolioDetailPage.tsx`: **Updated** to re-apply fixes for modal state management regressions.
    *   `frontend/src/services/portfolioApi.ts`: **Updated** to fix a regression with an incorrect API endpoint URL.
    *   `docs/bug_reports_temp.md`: Populated with detailed reports for each bug discovered and fixed.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full E2E test suite.
    - Performed manual E2E testing to verify the fixes for the UI regressions.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The "Asset-Level XIRR Analytics" feature is complete, stable, and fully tested.
    - All E2E tests are passing, and all known regressions have been resolved.

## 2025-08-11: Finalize Automated Data Import (Phase 2) & Documentation

*   **Task Description:** Complete the final remaining tasks for the "Automated Data Import - Phase 2" feature. This involved fixing a critical bug found during manual testing, implementing the final planned parser, and performing a comprehensive update of all project documentation to reflect the current state of the project.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Context Loading:** The user provided a detailed summary of the previous work, the list of pending tasks, and the specific bug to be fixed.
    2.  **Code Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to implement the required changes:
        *   "Fix the transaction sorting logic in `import_sessions.py`."
        *   "Implement the `IciciParser` based on the provided CSV format."
        *   "Register the new `IciciParser` in the `parser_factory.py`."
    3.  **Documentation Update:** A systematic process was followed to update all 8 specified documentation files. For each file, the AI was prompted to read the current content and then apply the necessary updates to reflect the latest changes. This included adding bug reports, updating feature status, and creating a handoff summary.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/import_sessions.py`: **Updated** to sort transactions after parsing to prevent commit failures.
    *   `backend/app/services/import_parsers/icici_parser.py`: **Updated** with the full implementation for ICICI Direct tradebook files.
    *   `backend/app/services/import_parsers/parser_factory.py`: **Updated** to include the new `IciciParser`.
    *   `docs/bug_reports.md`: **Updated** with a new report for the transaction sorting bug.
    *   `docs/features/07_automated_data_import.md`: **Updated** to reflect the completion of Phase 2.
    *   `docs/workflow_history.md`: **Updated** with this entry.
    *   `docs/troubleshooting.md`: **Updated** with new sections for data import and Docker issues.

## 2025-08-12: Fix E2E and Backend Test Failures

*   **Task Description:** A comprehensive debugging and fixing session to resolve a cascade of E2E and backend test failures. The root cause was a bug in the asset alias lookup logic, which was compounded by issues in the test fixtures and the Docker environment setup.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial E2E Failure Analysis:** The user provided a failing E2E test log for the asset alias feature. The AI correctly hypothesized that the alias was not being applied in a subsequent import.
    2.  **Systematic Investigation:** A deep dive into the backend code revealed that the `ImportSession` model was not persisting the `source` of the import, making a source-specific alias lookup impossible.
    3.  **Environment Debugging:** While attempting to generate a database migration for the model change, the AI discovered that the `alembic revision` command was failing silently. After investigating the `docker-compose.yml` file, the AI found that the `backend` service was missing a volume mount, which prevented code changes from being reflected inside the container. This was a critical fix for the development environment.
    4.  **Comprehensive Bug Fix:** After fixing the environment, a full-stack fix was implemented:
        *   The `ImportSession` model and schemas were updated to include the `source` field.
        *   A new Alembic migration was successfully generated and applied.
        *   The `create_import_session` endpoint was updated to save the `source_type`.
        *   The `get_by_alias` CRUD method and the `get_import_session_preview` endpoint were updated to perform source-specific lookups.
    5.  **Test Suite Stabilization:** After the main bug fix, a new set of backend test failures appeared. The AI diagnosed these as `NotNullViolation` errors in the test fixtures (which were not providing the new `source` field) and `TypeError`s in CRUD tests (which were not updated to pass the new `source` argument). These were systematically fixed.
    6.  **Final Verification:** The full backend and E2E test suites were run successfully, confirming that all issues were resolved.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `docker-compose.yml`: **Updated** to add a volume mount to the `backend` service.
    *   `backend/app/models/import_session.py`: **Updated** to add the `source` column.
    *   `backend/alembic/versions/...`: **New** database migration file created.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/import_session.py`: **Updated** to include `source` in the relevant schemas.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/import_sessions.py`: **Updated** to save and use the `source` of the import session.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_asset_alias.py`: **Updated** to make the alias lookup source-specific.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/test_import_sessions.py`: **Updated** all test fixtures to include the `source` field.
    *   `backend/app/tests/crud/test_asset_alias_crud.py`: **Updated** tests to pass the `source` argument.
    *   `e2e/tests/data-import-mapping.spec.ts`: **Refactored** to use a `beforeEach` hook for login to improve stability.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite (86 passed).
    - Ran the full E2E test suite (10 passed).

*   **Outcome:**
    - All E2E and backend tests are now passing. The application is stable, and the data import feature correctly handles source-specific asset aliases. The development environment is now more robust.

## 2025-08-12: Fix E2E Test for Asset Alias Mapping

*   **Task Description:** Fix a failing E2E test for the asset alias mapping feature. The test `should automatically use the created alias for subsequent imports` in `data-import-mapping.spec.ts` was consistently failing with a timeout.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Investigation:** The initial investigation focused on the backend, with a hypothesis that database transactions were not being committed correctly between test steps. This led to suggesting changes in `backend/app/db/session.py` and adding extensive logging.
    2.  **Root Cause Identification (User-led):** The user provided the crucial insight that the problem was not in the backend, but in the test itself. The test was waiting for the UI element `Transactions Needing Mapping (0)` to be visible. However, on a successful run where the alias is correctly applied, this element is never rendered, causing the test to time out.
    3.  **Targeted Fix:** Based on the user's feedback, the AI pivoted to a frontend-only fix. The test assertion was changed to be more robust, verifying that the main "Import Preview" heading is visible and that the "Commit" button is present, which correctly confirms the success state without relying on a conditionally rendered element.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `e2e/tests/data-import-mapping.spec.ts`: **Updated** the test assertions to be more robust and not rely on a conditionally rendered element.
    *   `docs/bug_reports_temp.md`: **Updated** the bug report for this issue with the correct root cause and resolution.
    *   `docs/workflow_history.md`: **Updated** with this entry.

*   **Verification:**
    - The changes are being submitted without running the test suite, as per user instruction. The validation will be performed by the CI/CD git workflow.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The E2E test for asset alias mapping has been fixed by correcting the test's assertion logic. This resolves the final blocker for the data import feature.

---

## 2025-08-12: Implement Asset Alias Mapping

*   **Task Description:** Implement the "Asset Alias Mapping" feature as part of the data import workflow. This allows users to map unrecognized ticker symbols from an import file to existing assets in the system on the fly.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the full-stack implementation. This included:
        *   Updating the backend preview endpoint to categorize unrecognized symbols into a `needs_mapping` list.
        *   Refactoring the `AssetAliasMappingModal` to include an asset search input.
        *   Creating a new `useAssetSearch` hook for the frontend.
        *   Implementing state management to collect and commit the new aliases.
    2.  **E2E Test Generation:** The AI was prompted to create a new E2E test file (`data-import-mapping.spec.ts`) to validate the entire workflow.
    3.  **Bug Fixing:** The AI fixed a critical bug in the `CRUDAssetAlias` class where the `get_by_alias` method was missing.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/import_sessions.py`: **Updated** to categorize transactions needing mapping.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/import_session.py`: **Updated** to include the `needs_mapping` field.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_asset_alias.py`: **Updated** to add the missing `get_by_alias` method.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/Import/ImportPreviewPage.tsx`: **Updated** to render the new mapping section and modal.
    *   `frontend/src/components/modals/AssetAliasMappingModal.tsx`: **Updated** with asset search functionality.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/useAssets.ts`: **New** file with the `useAssetSearch` hook.
    *   `e2e/tests/data-import-mapping.spec.ts`: **New** E2E test file for the feature.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The full-stack implementation for asset alias mapping is complete.
    - All backend and frontend unit/integration tests are passing.
    - A new E2E test was created, but it is failing with a timeout, blocking the final validation of the feature. The project is being prepared for a handoff to debug this final issue.

---

**Date:** 2025-08-22
**Objective:** To diagnose and fix the final remaining E2E test failures to achieve a 100% stable test suite.

### 1. Initial State & Problem Analysis

The E2E test suite was failing with multiple timeout errors, primarily in `transaction-history.spec.ts` and `admin-user-management.spec.ts`. The core issues were modals not appearing and features breaking due to incorrect data flow.

### 2. AI-Assisted Plan & Execution

1.  **Root Cause Analysis:** A thorough analysis of the `log.txt` file was performed. This revealed two distinct root causes:
    *   **Backend Bug:** The `GET /api/v1/transactions/` endpoint was returning incomplete `Transaction` objects, missing the `portfolio_id`. This broke the "Edit Transaction" feature on the frontend.
    *   **Frontend Bug:** The `UserManagementPage.tsx` component was not conditionally rendering the `UserFormModal`, preventing it from appearing when triggered.

2.  **Targeted Fixes:** Based on the analysis, two precise fixes were implemented:
    *   **Backend:** The `schemas/transaction.py` Pydantic model was updated to include the `portfolio_id`, ensuring the API response adhered to the data contract expected by the frontend.
    *   **Frontend:** The `UserManagementPage.tsx` component was updated to wrap the `<UserFormModal>` in a conditional block (`{isFormModalOpen && ...}`), ensuring it is only mounted and rendered when active.

### 3. Verification & Outcome

*   **E2E Tests:** A full run of the E2E test suite was executed.
*   **Result:** **Success.** All 12 E2E tests passed, confirming that both the backend data contract issue and the frontend modal rendering bug were resolved. The application is now in a fully stable, "green" state.

### 4. Documentation Update

*   `docs/bug_reports.md`: Added final bug reports for the issues discovered and resolved.
*   `docs/project_handoff_summary.md`: Updated to reflect the stable status and explicitly mention the new Transaction History page.
*   `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md`: Added a new entry on the importance of API data contracts.
*   `docs/workflow_history.md`: This entry was created.

### 5. Final Changed Files

*   `backend/app/schemas/transaction.py`
*   `frontend/src/pages/Admin/UserManagementPage.tsx`
*   `docs/bug_reports.md`
*   `docs/project_handoff_summary.md`
*   `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md`
*   `docs/workflow_history.md`

## 2025-08-24: Backend for Watchlists (Phase 1)

*   **Task Description:** Implement the backend foundation for the Watchlists feature (FR8.1). This included creating the database models, Pydantic schemas, CRUD logic, and API endpoints for basic watchlist management.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Code Generation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the new files for the feature, following the existing project structure: `watchlist.py` for models and schemas, `crud_watchlist.py` for business logic, and `watchlists.py` for API endpoints.
    2.  **Alembic Migration:** A significant challenge was encountered while trying to generate the database migration. The AI assistant (Jules) systematically debugged the issue:
        *   Identified that `alembic` was not in the PATH.
        *   Attempted to run it via `python -m`, which failed.
        *   Correctly deduced from `pytest` logs that a `pipx` environment was being used, but was unable to find the `alembic` executable there.
        *   The user provided guidance to `pip install alembic` and to be prepared to write the migration manually.
        *   After installing, a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `pydantic` occurred, which was fixed by installing all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
        *   Next, a database connection error (`could not translate host name "db"`) occurred. The AI correctly diagnosed this as a Docker-specific environment variable and attempted to override it.
        *   This led to a `Target database is not up to date` error, which was then followed by an `(sqlite3.OperationalError) near "ALTER": syntax error` when trying to upgrade the local DB.
    3.  **Manual Migration:** Acknowledging the user's advice and the environmental complexity, the AI pivoted to creating the migration script manually, which was successful.
    4.  **Test Generation & Debugging:** The AI generated a full test suite for the new endpoints. The tests initially failed with an `AttributeError` because the new `crud.watchlist` object was not exposed in `crud/__init__.py`. The AI identified and fixed this import issue, leading to a fully passing test suite.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/models/watchlist.py`: **New** file with `Watchlist` and `WatchlistItem` models.
    *   `backend/app/models/user.py` & `asset.py`: **Updated** with `back_populates` relationships.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/watchlist.py`: **New** file with Pydantic schemas.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_watchlist.py`: **New** file with business logic for watchlists.
    *   `backend/app/crud/__init__.py`: **Updated** to expose the new `watchlist` CRUD object.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/watchlists.py`: **New** file with API endpoints for watchlist CRUD.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/api.py`: **Updated** to include the new `watchlists` router.
    *   `backend/alembic/versions/dff8e00ff3d0_....py`: **New** manually created database migration.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_watchlists.py`: **New** test suite for the feature.
    *   `backend/app/tests/utils/watchlist.py`: **New** test helper for creating watchlists.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the new test suite in isolation using `./run_local_tests.sh backend app/tests/api/v1/test_watchlists.py`.
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh backend`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The backend foundation for the Watchlists feature is complete and stable.
    - All 94 backend tests are passing, confirming the new feature works and has not introduced any regressions.

---

## 2025-08-24: Frontend for Watchlists (Phase 2)

*   **Task Description:** Implement the frontend UI and data layer for managing watchlists (FR8.1, Phase 2). This included creating the page, components, and hooks for creating, renaming, and deleting watchlists, and then stabilizing the new unit tests.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the full-stack of frontend files: `watchlist.ts` (types), `watchlistApi.ts` (API service), `useWatchlists.ts` (React Query hooks), `WatchlistFormModal.tsx`, `WatchlistSelector.tsx`, and the main `WatchlistsPage.tsx`. The page was also added to the main router and navigation bar.
    2.  **Test Generation:** The AI was prompted to generate a full suite of unit tests for all the new components and hooks.
    3.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The initial test run failed with multiple errors across all new test files. A systematic, iterative debugging process was used to fix them:
        *   The AI initially misdiagnosed a persistent ESLint parsing error in `useWatchlists.test.ts`, attempting several incorrect fixes.
        *   The user provided the correct root cause: the test file contained JSX but had a `.ts` extension instead of `.tsx`. This was a critical insight that the AI had missed.
        *   After the user's guidance, the AI renamed the file to `useWatchlists.test.tsx`, which immediately fixed the parsing error and allowed the other test failures to be diagnosed correctly.
        *   The remaining test failures were then fixed, including associating form labels with inputs in the modal and adding `aria-label`s to icon buttons for accessibility.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `frontend/src/types/watchlist.ts`: **New** file for watchlist type definitions.
    *   `frontend/src/services/watchlistApi.ts`: **New** API service for watchlist endpoints.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/useWatchlists.ts`: **New** React Query hooks for state management.
    *   `frontend/src/components/modals/WatchlistFormModal.tsx`: **New** modal for creating/editing watchlists.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Watchlists/WatchlistSelector.tsx`: **New** component for listing and managing watchlists.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/WatchlistsPage.tsx`: **New** page to host the feature.
    *   `frontend/src/components/NavBar.tsx` & `frontend/src/App.tsx`: **Updated** to include the new page.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/`: **New** test files for all of the above, which were created and then debugged. `useWatchlists.test.ts` was renamed to `useWatchlists.test.tsx`.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full frontend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh frontend`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The frontend for Phase 2 of the Watchlists feature is complete, stable, and fully tested.
    - All 110 frontend tests are passing.

---

## 2025-08-24: Full-Stack for Watchlist Item Management (Phase 3)

*   **Task Description:** Implement the full-stack functionality for adding and removing assets from a watchlist (FR8.1, Phase 3).

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Backend Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to implement the backend functionality. This included creating a new `CRUDWatchlistItem` class, adding the corresponding API endpoints (`POST /items`, `DELETE /items/{item_id}`), and updating the `GET /{id}` endpoint to eager load asset details for display on the frontend.
    2.  **Backend Testing & Debugging:** The AI generated new tests for the item management endpoints. An initial test failure (`AttributeError: asset`) was traced to an incorrect use of a Pydantic schema instead of a SQLAlchemy model in a `joinedload` call. Another failure (`AssertionError: assert 200 == 201`) was fixed by adding the correct `status_code` to the endpoint decorator. A final failure was due to a brittle, order-dependent assertion, which was fixed by making the test check for the presence of items in any order.
    3.  **Frontend Implementation:** The AI was prompted to generate the frontend data layer (API service functions and React Query hooks) and UI components (`WatchlistTable`, `AddAssetToWatchlistModal`) to support the new functionality. These were then integrated into the main `WatchlistsPage`.
    4.  **Frontend Testing:** A full suite of tests was generated for the new components and updated for the existing ones. All tests passed on the first try after the previous phase's stabilization efforts.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_watchlist_item.py`: **New** file for item-specific CRUD.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/watchlists.py`: **Updated** with new endpoints and eager loading.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/watchlist.py`: **Updated** to include nested asset details in responses.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_watchlists.py`: **Updated** with tests for item management.
    *   `frontend/src/services/watchlistApi.ts`: **Updated** with new functions for item management.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/useWatchlists.ts`: **Updated** with new hooks for fetching single watchlists and managing items.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Watchlists/WatchlistTable.tsx`: **New** component.
    *   `frontend/src/components/modals/AddAssetToWatchlistModal.tsx`: **New** component.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/WatchlistsPage.tsx`: **Updated** to integrate the new components.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/`: **New** and **updated** test files for the new functionality.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh backend` (98 tests passed).
    - Ran the full frontend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh frontend` (122 tests passed).

*   **Outcome:**
    - The full-stack functionality for adding and removing items from a watchlist is complete, stable, and fully tested. The project is ready for the final phase of the feature.

---

## 2025-08-26: Stabilize Watchlist E2E and Frontend Tests

*   **Task Description:** The E2E test suite for the recently implemented Watchlist feature (FR8.1) was failing. The primary goal was to diagnose the root cause, fix the bugs, and get all test suites (E2E, frontend, backend) to a stable, passing state.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The core of this task was a long and iterative debugging process. At each stage, the failing test log (from Playwright or Jest) was analyzed to form a hypothesis. This was a process of elimination that uncovered multiple, layered bugs.
    2.  **User-Provided Logs & Manual Testing Insights:** The user's feedback was critical. They provided backend logs with a full traceback that was not visible to the AI, which pinpointed the root cause of the main bug. They also provided feedback from manual testing that identified a minor UI glitch.
    3.  **Iterative Fixing:** For each identified bug, a targeted fix was applied. This included:
        *   **Environment:** Fixing the test environment's dependency installation by updating `backend/requirements-dev.in`.
        *   **State Management:** Removing a duplicate React Query `QueryClientProvider` that was breaking cache invalidation.
        *   **Backend:** Fixing a `DetachedInstanceError` in the `remove_watchlist_item` endpoint by eagerly loading the `asset` relationship before deletion.
        *   **Frontend:** Fixing a UI state bug where the page would not reset after a watchlist was deleted, and fixing a minor UI glitch in the "Add Asset" modal.
        *   **Tests:** Updating the E2E test to use more robust locators and updating the frontend unit test to account for a change in a function signature.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/watchlists.py`: **Updated** the `remove_watchlist_item` endpoint to prevent a `DetachedInstanceError`.
    *   `frontend/src/components/modals/AddAssetToWatchlistModal.tsx`: **Updated** to fix a minor UI glitch.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Watchlists/WatchlistSelector.tsx`: **Updated** to correctly handle UI state after a watchlist is deleted.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/components/Watchlists/WatchlistSelector.test.tsx`: **Updated** a unit test to align with the new code.
    *   `e2e/tests/watchlists.spec.ts`: **Updated** to use more robust locators.
    *   `frontend/src/main.tsx` & `frontend/src/App.tsx`: **Updated** to remove a duplicate `QueryClientProvider`.
    *   `backend/requirements-dev.in`: **Updated** to include base requirements.
    *   `backend/app/crud/base.py`: **Updated** to remove a speculative `db.flush()` that was added during debugging.

*   **Verification:**

## 2025-08-26: Implement & Stabilize Audit Logging Engine (FR-2.2)

*   **Task Description:** Implement a full-stack Audit Logging Engine to track key user and system events. This was a backend-heavy feature that involved creating new database models, services, and API integrations, followed by a significant multi-stage debugging effort to stabilize the test suite.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the backend foundation, including the `AuditLog` model, Pydantic schemas, `CRUDAuditLog` class, and a central `log_event` service. This service was then integrated into the `auth` and `users` endpoints to log login attempts, user creation, and user deletion.
    2.  **Database Migration:** The initial attempt to auto-generate an Alembic migration failed. The AI then pivoted to creating the migration script manually to add the `audit_logs` table.
    3.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The initial test run after implementation failed with 8 errors. A multi-stage debugging process was required:
        *   **User Correction:** The AI assistant initially misread the test summary and attempted to submit the code with failing tests. The user provided a critical correction, prompting a deeper investigation into the failures.
        *   **TypeError in `CRUDUser.create`:** The first class of errors was a `TypeError` because the `CRUDUser.create` method did not accept an `is_admin` keyword argument being passed from the `/auth/setup` endpoint. This was fixed by updating the method signature in `crud_user.py`.
        *   **UUID Serialization Error:** The second class of errors was a `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable`. This occurred when the SQLite backend tried to serialize the `details` field of the audit log, which contained raw UUID objects. The fix was to explicitly convert all UUIDs to strings in the `users.py` endpoint before passing them to the `log_event` service.
    4.  **Final Verification:** After applying the fixes, the full test suite was run again, and all tests passed.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/models/audit_log.py`: **New** file with the `AuditLog` SQLAlchemy model.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/audit_log.py`: **New** file with the `AuditLog` Pydantic schemas.

    *   `backend/app/services/audit_logger.py`: **New** file for the centralized `log_event` service.
    *   `backend/alembic/versions/067d0411efbc_add_audit_logs_table.py`: **New** manually-created database migration.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`: **Updated** to log `USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS` and `USER_LOGIN_FAILURE` events.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py`: **Updated** to log `USER_CREATED` and `USER_DELETED` events and to serialize UUIDs in log details.
    *   `backend/app/tests/services/test_audit_logger.py`: **New** unit test for the audit logger service.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_auth.py`: **Updated** with tests for login-related audit events.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_users_admin.py`: **Updated** with tests for user management audit events.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh all`. All linters, backend tests (99), frontend tests (123), and E2E tests (14) passed.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The Audit Logging Engine is now fully implemented, tested, and stable. The development process for this feature highlighted the importance of careful test log analysis and the critical role of human oversight in the AI-assisted workflow.

## 2025-08-30: Implement User Profile Management & Fix Critical Encryption Bug (FR1.5)

*   **Task Description:** Implement the full-stack "User Profile Management" feature, allowing users to update their full name and change their password. This task involved a significant, multi-stage debugging effort to identify and fix a critical security bug in the desktop application's encryption key management.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the backend API endpoints (`/users/me`, `/auth/me/change-password`), Pydantic schemas, and CRUD logic. On the frontend, prompts were used to create the `ProfilePage`, `UpdateProfileForm`, `ChangePasswordForm`, React Query hooks, and a new `userApi` service.
    2.  **E2E Test Creation:** An E2E test (`profile-management.spec.ts`) was created to validate the feature. This test initially caused state pollution issues with other tests, which was resolved by creating a new, isolated user within the test itself.
    3.  **UI/UX Refinement:** Based on user feedback, the UI was refactored to match the application's design system, and a custom toast notification system was implemented to replace blocking `alert()` popups.
    4.  **Deep Debugging & Root Cause Analysis:** A backend test, `test_change_password_success`, was consistently failing in the `desktop` mode environment with a `cryptography.exceptions.InvalidTag` error.
        *   The initial hypothesis that data needed to be re-encrypted was incorrect.
        *   After guidance from the user, a deep dive into the `KeyManager` class revealed the root cause: the `change_password` function was incorrectly generating a **new** master key instead of re-wrapping the **existing** one.
        *   This was a critical security and data integrity bug that would have resulted in permanent data loss for users who changed their password.
    5.  **Critical Bug Fix:** The `KeyManager` was refactored to correctly decrypt the master key with the old password, and then re-wrap the *same* key with the new password, preserving all user data.
    6.  **Environment & Tooling Issues:** The final test run was blocked by a `permission denied` error with Docker. The user provided the crucial information that `sudo` was required, which unblocked the process and allowed the final verification to complete.
    7.  **Final Cleanup:** After a final review, accidental snapshot test artifacts were removed from the repository.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/core/key_manager.py`: **Updated** to fix the critical password change bug.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/user.py`: **Updated** with `UserUpdateMe` and `UserPasswordChange` schemas.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_user.py`: **Updated** with `update_me` method.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/me.py`: **New** file with the `PUT /me` endpoint.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_auth.py`: **Restored** accidentally deleted password change tests.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`: **New** page.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Profile/`: **New** directory with `UpdateProfileForm.tsx` and `ChangePasswordForm.tsx`.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts`: **New** React Query hooks.
    *   `frontend/src/services/userApi.ts`: **New** API service.
    *   `frontend/src/context/ToastContext.tsx`: **New** context for toast notifications.
    *   `e2e/tests/profile-management.spec.ts`: **New** E2E test suite for the feature.
    *   `e2e/tests/profile-management.spec.ts-snapshots/`: **Deleted** snapshot files.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite for desktop mode using `sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.desktop.yml run --rm test-desktop`. All 108 tests passed.
    - Ran the full E2E test suite.
    - Received manual E2E test pass confirmation from the user.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Refactoring & Test Rewrite:** The AI was prompted to update the transaction test suite, which involved a complete rewrite of `test_portfolios_transactions.py` (renamed to `test_transactions.py`) to align with new, more robust backend logic.
    2.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The initial implementation introduced a cascade of test failures. A highly iterative "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" workflow was used to resolve them. This included fixing `ImportError`s from unexposed schemas, `AttributeError`s from incomplete mock services, and `TypeError`s from outdated test helper functions.
    3.  **Final Test Fix:** The final failure was a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error. The AI analyzed the log and identified that the test was sending a full `datetime` string to an endpoint that expected a simple `date` string, and provided the final fix.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/transactions.py`: **Updated** to handle ticker-based creation and improved filtering.
    *   `backend/app/crud/asset.py`: **Updated** with `get_or_create_by_ticker` logic.

## 2025-08-31: Final E2E Test Stabilization & Code Cleanup

*   **Task Description:** A final pass to stabilize the E2E test suite and clean up the codebase. This involved fixing a flaky test for the Advanced Analytics feature by making its assertion more precise, and then resolving a resulting backend linting issue.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **E2E Test Analysis:** The user provided a failing E2E test log for the analytics feature. The AI analyzed the log and identified that the test was failing due to a hardcoded assertion (`8.00%`) that was not resilient to minor changes in the XIRR calculation based on the current date.
    2.  **Improving Test Precision:** The user prompted, "But how do we verify XIRR is calculated correctly?". This led to a collaborative effort where the AI calculated the expected XIRR value (30.00%) based on the test's inputs and then updated the E2E test to parse the value from the UI and assert that it was within a tight tolerance of the expected result.
    3.  **Linting Fix:** After the test was stabilized, the user ran the backend linter, which reported a `line-too-long` error in `mock_financial_data.py`. The AI was prompted to fix this final linting issue.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `e2e/tests/analytics.spec.ts`: **Updated** the XIRR test to parse the percentage from the UI and assert it's within a tight tolerance of the expected value (30.00%), making the test both precise and robust.
    *   `backend/app/tests/utils/mock_financial_data.py`: **Updated** to reformat long dictionary entries to comply with the project's line-length limit.
    *   `backend/app/tests/utils/mock_financial_data.py`: **Removed** a temporary debug logger that was added in a previous session.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full E2E test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh e2e`.
    - Ran the backend linter using `docker compose run --rm backend sh -c "ruff check . --fix"`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The Advanced Analytics E2E test is now robust and correctly verifies the calculation.
    - The backend codebase is fully compliant with linting rules.
    - The project is in a fully stable state, with all tests passing and all code quality checks met.

## 2025-09-02: Implement Privacy Mode (FR3.4)

*   **Task Description:** Implement a "Privacy Mode" feature that allows users to obscure sensitive monetary values across the application with a single toggle.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** The AI was prompted to implement the feature based on the plan. It correctly created a `PrivacyContext` and refactored the `formatCurrency` utility to use it.
    2.  **User-led Course Correction:** The user provided critical feedback that the initial approach was too broad, hiding all monetary values including non-sensitive ones like individual stock prices.
    3.  **Revised Plan & Refactoring:** A new plan was formulated to address the feedback. This involved:
        *   Resetting all previous changes.
        *   Creating a new, specific hook (`usePrivacySensitiveCurrency`).
        *   Selectively applying this hook *only* to high-level summary components (`SummaryCard`, `PortfolioSummary`, etc.) while leaving others untouched.
    4.  **E2E Test Correction:** The E2E test was updated to verify the new, correct behavior: asserting that summary values are hidden while table values remain visible in privacy mode.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `frontend/src/context/PrivacyContext.tsx`: **New** file to manage the global privacy state.
    *   `frontend/src/utils/formatting.ts`: **Updated** to add the `usePrivacySensitiveCurrency` hook.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`: **Updated** to add the UI toggle.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/SummaryCard.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/PortfolioSummary.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/Goals/...`: **Updated** to use the new selective hook.
    *   `e2e/tests/privacy-mode.spec.ts`: **New** E2E test to validate the selective obscuring.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/`: **New** unit tests for the context and hook.
    *   `docs/features/FR3.4_privacy_mode.md`: **Updated** status to "Implemented".

*   **Verification:**
    - The full test suite will be run before submission.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The "Privacy Mode" feature is implemented according to the refined user requirements. It correctly hides only high-level sensitive data, providing a better user experience. This task highlights the importance of clear requirements and iterative feedback in an AI-assisted workflow.

## 2025-09-04: Holdings Table Redesign (FR4.7.2)

*   **Task Description:** Implement the "Holdings Table Redesign" feature. This involved a major refactoring of the portfolio detail page to replace the flat holdings table with a new, sectioned view where assets are grouped by class into collapsible accordion sections.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the full-stack implementation. This included updating the backend to add a `group` field to the holdings data, and creating the new frontend components (`HoldingsTable`, `EquityHoldingRow`, `DepositHoldingRow`, `BondHoldingRow`) to render the new UI.
    2.  **Systematic Debugging via Manual E2E Feedback:** The initial implementation had several bugs that were discovered during manual E2E testing by the user. The user provided detailed feedback, which was used to systematically debug and fix the issues:
        *   **Frontend Crashing:** The AI diagnosed that this was caused by missing dependencies in the production environment and incorrect file paths for the new components. The fix involved correcting the file paths and instructing the user on how to rebuild the Docker container to install the new dependencies.
        *   **Incorrect "Total Value" Calculation:** The AI analyzed the user's console logs and identified that the `current_value` was a string, causing a calculation error. This was fixed by converting the value to a number.
        *   **Incorrect Mutual Fund Display:** The AI fixed a bug where the scheme number was being shown for mutual funds instead of just the name.
        *   **Missing Sorting Functionality:** The AI implemented sorting for each section and then fixed a bug where numeric columns were being sorted as strings.
    3.  **E2E Test Stabilization:** A significant amount of time was spent trying to fix a failing E2E test for the mutual fund selection. The AI tried multiple locators and debugging strategies, but was ultimately unable to resolve the issue without the user's direct feedback and insights from their manual testing.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/schemas/holding.py`: **Updated** to add the `group` field.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_holding.py`: **Updated** to populate the `group` field.

## 2025-09-07: Implement & Stabilize Recurring Deposit Tracking (FR4.3.3)

*   **Task Description:** A full-stack implementation of the Recurring Deposit (RD) tracking feature. This was a complex task that involved creating the backend data models, a dedicated drill-down UI, and implementing financial calculations for valuation and XIRR. The task also included a significant, multi-stage debugging and stabilization effort to resolve issues with the test environment, database migrations, and core application logic.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the full backend stack for RDs (`RecurringDeposit` model, schemas, CRUD, API endpoints) and the corresponding frontend components (`RecurringDepositDetailModal`, updates to `TransactionFormModal`).
    2.  **Iterative Debugging of Core Logic:** The core of the interaction was a highly iterative debugging loop. The user provided detailed feedback from manual testing and code reviews, which uncovered several critical bugs:
        *   **XIRR Calculation:** The user reported that the XIRR for RDs was incorrect. The AI implemented two different valuation logics (`_calculate_rd_value_at_date`) before settling on a more accurate method based on calculating the future value of each installment. The unit test was updated to match this new, correct value.
        *   **Backend Crash (`pydantic_core.ValidationError`):** The user reported that the application crashed when viewing a portfolio with an RD that had no `account_number`. The AI diagnosed this as a Pydantic validation error and fixed it by providing a fallback value for the `ticker_symbol` in `crud_holding.py`.
    3.  **Test Environment Stabilization:** A significant amount of time was spent debugging the test environment. This included:
        *   Fixing the `run_local_tests.sh` script to correctly initialize the database for backend tests.
        *   Fixing a `RuntimeError` related to the encryption `KeyManager` not being loaded in tests by adding the `pre_unlocked_key_manager` fixture.
        *   Fixing numerous linting errors reported by `ruff`.
    4.  **Manual Database Migration:** The Alembic `autogenerate` command proved to be unreliable in the test environment. After multiple failed attempts, the AI pivoted to creating the database migration script manually to add the `account_number` column.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/models/recurring_deposit.py`: **New** SQLAlchemy model.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/recurring_deposit.py`: **New** Pydantic schemas.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_recurring_deposit.py`: **New** CRUD module.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/recurring_deposits.py`: **New** API router.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_holding.py`: **Updated** to correctly calculate RD holdings and handle missing account numbers.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_analytics.py`: **Updated** to include RDs in portfolio-level XIRR calculations.
    *   `backend/alembic/versions/2fc13ed78a51_....py`: **New** manually created database migration.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_recurring_deposits.py`: **New** test suite, later fixed for encryption and valuation logic.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/RecurringDepositDetailModal.tsx`: **New** component for the drill-down view.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/TransactionFormModal.tsx`: **Updated** to include the RD form.
    *   `run_local_tests.sh`: **Updated** to correctly initialize the database for backend tests.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The Recurring Deposit tracking feature is fully implemented, tested, and stable.
    - All backend, frontend, and E2E tests are passing. This task was a testament to the importance of a robust test suite and the ability to debug and overcome complex environmental and logical issues.

## 2025-09-13: Implement & Stabilize PPF Tracking Feature (FR4.3.4)

*   **Task Description:** A full-stack implementation of the backend logic for tracking Public Provident Fund (PPF) accounts. This was a highly complex task that involved implementing nuanced financial calculations and a deep, iterative debugging cycle to stabilize the entire backend test suite.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the initial backend logic for PPF valuation in `crud_ppf.py` and the corresponding tests in `test_ppf_holdings.py`.
    2.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The initial implementation introduced a cascade of over 30 test failures. The core of the work was a highly iterative "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" loop where the user provided the `log.txt` from a failing test run, and the AI diagnosed the root cause and provided a targeted fix. This process was repeated for numerous bugs, including:
        *   `AttributeError` due to missing or incorrect CRUD methods.
        *   `TypeError` due to incorrect function call signatures and keyword arguments.
        *   `ValidationError` from Pydantic due to schema mismatches between the logic and the `Holding` model.
        *   `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors due to incorrect API endpoint parameter types.
        *   `AssertionError` due to flawed interest calculation logic, which was fixed by implementing the correct "minimum balance between 5th and end of month" rule.
        *   `UnboundLocalError` due to incorrect variable initialization.
        *   `TypeError` in the test suite due to incorrect mocking of the `datetime.date` object.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_ppf.py`: **New** file with the core business logic for PPF interest calculation and holdings processing.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_ppf_holdings.py`: **New** test suite to validate the PPF feature.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_holding.py`, `backend/app/schemas/holding.py`, `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/transactions.py`: **Updated** to integrate the PPF logic and fix related bugs.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh backend`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The backend for the PPF Tracking feature is complete, stable, and fully tested. All 125 backend tests are now passing. This was a major stabilization effort that touched many parts of the backend codebase.

## 2025-09-15: Stabilize Frontend Unit Test Suite

*   **Task Description:** A final stabilization pass on the frontend unit test suite, which had two remaining failures after recent backend changes to the analytics API.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Log Analysis:** The user provided the `log.txt` from the failing `npm test` run. The AI analyzed the log and identified the two failing test suites: `HoldingDetailModal.test.tsx` and `AnalyticsCard.test.tsx`.
    2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI diagnosed the root cause as a data mismatch between the test mocks and the component logic. The backend API was updated to return XIRR values as percentages (e.g., `7.14`), but the frontend unit tests were still mocking the data as raw rates (e.g., `0.0714`). The components were correctly formatting the small number to `0.07%`, causing the test assertions for `7.14%` to fail.
    3.  **Targeted Fix:** The AI provided a single, consolidated fix to update the mock data in both `HoldingDetailModal.test.tsx` and `AnalyticsCard.test.tsx`, aligning the tests with the current application behavior.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/components/Portfolio/HoldingDetailModal.test.tsx`: **Updated** mock data to use percentage values.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/components/Portfolio/AnalyticsCard.test.tsx`: **Updated** mock data to use percentage values.
    *   `docs/workflow_history.md`: **Updated** with this entry.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full frontend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh frontend`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The entire frontend test suite is now stable, with all 146 tests passing.
    - The project is in a fully "green" state across all test suites (backend, frontend, and E2E).

## 2025-09-17: Implement Admin UI for Interest Rate Management (FR4.3.4 - Phase 5)

*   **Task Description:** A full-stack implementation of the "Admin Interest Rate Management" feature. This provides administrators with a dedicated UI to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the historical interest rates used for calculations of government schemes like PPF.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the full backend stack (API endpoints in `admin_interest_rates.py`, CRUD logic in `crud_historical_interest_rate.py`) and the full frontend stack (`InterestRateManagementPage.tsx`, `InterestRateTable.tsx`, `InterestRateFormModal.tsx`, `useInterestRates.ts` hooks, and `adminApi.ts` service functions).
    2.  **E2E Test Generation:** An E2E test (`admin-interest-rates.spec.ts`) was created to validate the full CRUD user flow.
    3.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The E2E test failed with a timeout on the "delete" step. A deep, iterative debugging process was required to find the root cause.
        *   The AI first diagnosed an API contract mismatch: the backend `DELETE` endpoint was returning a `200 OK` with a body, while the frontend expected a `204 No Content`. This was fixed.
        *   The test still failed. The AI then diagnosed a race condition where the `addToast` notification was causing a re-render that pre-empted the modal-closing state update. This was also fixed.
        *   The test still failed. The AI then diagnosed a subtle bug in the React Query `useMutation` hook pattern, where the component's `onSuccess` callback was replacing the hook's `onSuccess` (which handled cache invalidation). This was refactored to a more robust pattern.
        *   The test still failed. The user provided critical feedback comparing the failing `DELETE` endpoint (204) with other working `DELETE` endpoints (200 with body). This led to the final, correct diagnosis.
    4.  **Final Fix:** The backend `DELETE` endpoint was aligned with the application's established pattern (return `200 OK` with the deleted object), and the frontend was updated to match. This resolved the test failure.
    5.  **Linting & Final Test Stabilization:** The final phase involved fixing all backend and frontend linting errors and stabilizing a flaky E2E test assertion for floating-point values by making the comparison numeric rather than string-based.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin_interest_rates.py`: **New** file with CRUD endpoints.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_historical_interest_rate.py`: **New** file with business logic.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/historical_interest_rate.py`: **Updated** to make `HistoricalInterestRateUpdate` inherit from the base class.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/api.py`: **Updated** to include the new admin router.
    *   `frontend/src/pages/Admin/InterestRateManagementPage.tsx`: **New** page.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Admin/InterestRateTable.tsx`, `InterestRateFormModal.tsx`: **New** components.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/useInterestRates.ts`: **New** React Query hooks.
    *   `frontend/src/services/adminApi.ts`: **Updated** with new service functions.
    *   `frontend/src/App.tsx` & `frontend/src/components/NavBar.tsx`: **Updated** to include the new page.
    *   `e2e/tests/admin-interest-rates.spec.ts`: **New** E2E test suite for the feature.
    *   `docs/bug_reports.md`: **Updated** with a consolidated report for the E2E test failure.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh all`. All linters, backend tests (125), frontend tests (146), and E2E tests (15) passed.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The "Admin Interest Rate Management" feature is complete, stable, and fully tested.

## 2025-09-22: Backend for Bond Tracking (FR4.3.5 - Phase 1)

*   **Task Description:** Implement the full backend stack for the "Bond Tracking" feature. This included creating the database model, Pydantic schemas, CRUD logic, API endpoints, and a full suite of unit and integration tests.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the new files for the feature, following the existing project structure: `models/bond.py`, `schemas/bond.py`, `schemas/enums.py`, `crud/crud_bond.py`, and `api/v1/endpoints/bonds.py`.
    2.  **Database Migration:** The AI was prompted to generate the Alembic migration script to create the new `bonds` table.
    3.  **Module Integration:** Prompts were used to update the `__init__.py` files in the `crud` and `schemas` packages and to include the new `bonds` router in `portfolios.py`.
    4.  **Test Generation:** The AI generated comprehensive test suites for the new CRUD layer (`test_bond_crud.py`) and the API endpoints (`test_bonds.py`).
    5.  **Systematic Debugging:** The initial test run failed with a `TypeError` in `test_bond_crud.py`. The AI analyzed the log, identified that the test was using an incorrect helper function (`create_test_asset`), and refactored the test to use the correct, more robust pattern of creating assets via `crud.asset.create`, which is consistent with other tests in the project.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/models/bond.py`: **New** file with the `Bond` SQLAlchemy model.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/bond.py`: **New** file with Pydantic schemas for Bond.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/enums.py`: **New** file with `BondType` and `PaymentFrequency` enums.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_bond.py`: **New** file with business logic for bonds.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/bonds.py`: **New** file with API endpoints for bond CRUD.
    *   `backend/alembic/versions/a1b2c3d4e5f6_add_bonds_table.py`: **New** database migration.
    *   `backend/app/tests/crud/test_bond_crud.py`: **New** test suite for the CRUD layer.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_bonds.py`: **New** test suite for the API endpoints.
    *   `backend/app/models/asset.py`, `backend/app/crud/__init__.py`, `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py`, `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/portfolios.py`: **Updated** to integrate the new feature.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh backend`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The backend for the Bond Tracking feature is complete, stable, and fully tested.
    - All 140 backend tests are passing. The project is ready for the frontend implementation phase.

### Task: Stabilize the Asset Seeder

**Date:** 2025-09-24
**AI Assistant:** Gemini Code Assist
**Goal:** To debug and fix the `seed-assets` command, which was failing to import and classify thousands of assets correctly.

**Summary of AI's Output:**
The AI assistant guided a systematic debugging process by analyzing the `log.txt` file after each run of the seeder.

1.  **Initial Analysis:** The AI identified that the `bonds` table was empty and that many assets were being misclassified as `STOCK` due to a flawed logical order in the `_classify_asset` function.
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** Through a series of prompts and log analyses, the AI identified several other issues: overly restrictive logic for NSE corporate bonds, a parsing failure for the BSE master file, and overly strict data validation rules.
3.  **Final Solution:** The AI provided a series of patches to `backend/app/cli.py` that:
    *   Restored the correct classification priority (specific bond patterns first).
    *   Made the NSE bond classification logic more robust.
    *   Moved the CSV header cleaning logic to the correct function to ensure it runs for all files.
    *   Relaxed the validation rules to be more permissive while still ensuring data quality.
    *   Added a final `return None, None` to `_classify_asset` to prevent unhandled `TypeError` exceptions.
4.  **Cleanup:** The AI also performed a minor cleanup on `clean.sh`.

**File Changes:**

*   `modified`: `backend/app/cli.py` - Refactored `_classify_asset`, `_validate_and_clean_asset_row`, and `_parse_and_seed_exchange_data` to fix all classification and parsing bugs.
*   `modified`: `clean.sh` - Added `log2.txt` to the list of files to be removed.
*   `modified`: `docs/bug_reports.md` - Added a consolidated bug report for the seeder stabilization.
*   `modified`: `docs/workflow_history.md` - Added this entry.
*   `modified`: `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md` - Added an entry about the importance of control flow analysis over symptomatic patching.

## 2025-09-24: Implement Frontend UI for Bond Tracking (FR4.3.5 - Phases 2 & 3)

*   **Task Description:** A full-stack implementation of the frontend UI for adding bond transactions. This included creating the data layer (types, API services, React Query hooks) and updating the main transaction form to handle the "Bond" asset type with its specific fields. The task also involved a significant debugging effort to fix a series of cascading backend and frontend test failures that were uncovered during the process.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Initial Implementation:** A series of prompts were used to generate the frontend data layer (`types/bond.ts`, `hooks/usePortfolios.ts`, `services/portfolioApi.ts`) and to refactor the `TransactionFormModal.tsx` to include the new bond-specific form fields and logic.
    2.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The initial implementation introduced a cascade of over 10 test failures across the backend and frontend. A highly iterative "Analyze -> Report -> Fix" workflow was used to resolve them:
        *   **Frontend `TypeError`:** The `TransactionFormModal` test suite crashed because it was not mocking the new `useCreateBond` hook. This was the first and most direct bug.
        *   **E2E Test Timeout:** The analytics E2E test began timing out. The AI diagnosed a logic error in the test script where it was waiting for an API call (`POST /assets/`) that would never happen at that point in the user flow. The `waitForResponse` was moved to the correct step.
        *   **Backend Circular Import (`ImportError`):** After fixing the frontend tests, the application failed to start. The AI diagnosed a circular dependency loop between the `asset`, `bond`, and `transaction` Pydantic schemas. This was fixed by using a forward reference (`"Asset"`) in `transaction.py`.
        *   **Backend `PydanticUserError`:** The application still failed to start, this time with a `PydanticUserError` because the forward references were not being resolved. This was fixed by adding `model_rebuild()` calls to the schema files.
        *   **Backend `NameError`:** The `model_rebuild()` call itself then failed with a `NameError`. The AI diagnosed that the rebuild was happening before all modules were loaded. The fix was to move all `model_rebuild()` calls to a central location (`schemas/__init__.py`).
    3.  **Final Test Stabilization:** After the application was stable, a final backend test failure was identified in `test_bonds.py`. The test was asserting for an outdated `409 Conflict` error, but the endpoint had been correctly updated to use "upsert" logic. The test was updated to assert for the new, correct behavior (`201 Created`).

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `frontend/src/types/bond.ts`: **New** file for bond type definitions.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/usePortfolios.ts`: **Updated** with `useCreateBond` hook.
    *   `frontend/src/services/portfolioApi.ts`: **Updated** with `createBondTransaction` function.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/TransactionFormModal.tsx`: **Updated** to include the bond form and logic.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/components/Portfolio/TransactionFormModal.test.tsx`: **Updated** to mock the `useCreateBond` hook.
    *   `e2e/tests/analytics.spec.ts`: **Updated** to fix a test logic error causing a timeout.
    *   `backend/app/schemas/`: **Updated** `asset.py`, `transaction.py`, and `__init__.py` to resolve circular dependencies.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_bonds.py`: **Updated** to align with the new "upsert" logic.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh all`. All linters, backend tests (140), frontend tests (159), and E2E tests (21) passed.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The frontend UI for adding bond transactions is complete and stable.
    - All related test failures and regressions have been resolved, and the entire project is in a "green" state.
| Verification    | `docker compose run --rm backend python run_cli.py db seed-assets --debug`                            |

## 2025-10-06: Finalize Bond Tracking & Day's P&L Fix

*   **Task Description:** A final stabilization pass for the Bond Tracking feature. This involved fixing a critical bug in the Day's P&L calculation and updating the test suite to reflect the intentional removal of an unreliable SGB valuation fallback.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Bug Identification:** The user reported that the Day's P&L for bonds was massively inflated when a market price was unavailable.
    2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI analyzed the `crud_holding.py` file and identified the root cause: the `previous_close` price was not being handled in the book value fallback case, causing it to default to zero and leading to an incorrect P&L calculation.
    3.  **Test Failure Analysis:** After fixing the P&L bug, the backend test suite failed. The AI analyzed the `log.txt` and correctly identified that the failing test (`test_sgb_valuation_gold_price_fallback`) was now obsolete because the gold price fallback logic had been previously removed due to unreliability.
    4.  **Test Refactoring:** The AI was prompted to update the obsolete test. It correctly renamed the test to `test_sgb_valuation_book_value_fallback` and updated its assertions to verify the new, correct behavior (falling back to book value).

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_holding.py`: **Updated** to correctly set `previous_close` during the book value fallback, fixing the Day's P&L calculation.
    *   `backend/app/tests/crud/test_bond_crud.py`: **Updated** to align the SGB valuation test with the current application logic.
    *   `docs/bug_reports.md`: **Updated** with new reports for the Day's P&L bug and the obsolete test.
    *   `docs/features/FR4.3.5_bond_tracking_v2.md`: **Updated** to remove the gold price fallback from the documented strategy.
    *   `docs/workflow_history.md`: **Updated** with this entry.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `./run_local_tests.sh backend`. All 147 tests passed.
    - Manually verified the Day's P&L calculation in the UI.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The Bond Tracking feature is now fully stable and calculates all metrics correctly.
    - All automated tests are passing, and all documentation has been updated to reflect the final implementation. The project is in a clean, "green" state.

## 2025-10-09: Finalize Corporate Actions, Revert Unstable Analytics, & Documentation Sweep

*   **Task Description:** A final series of actions to close out the Corporate Actions feature. After manual E2E testing revealed significant and complex bugs in the financial metrics calculations (P&L, XIRR) related to dividend income, a strategic decision was made to revert these specific analytics changes to ensure application stability. The core feature of logging corporate actions remains stable. A full documentation sweep was then performed to reflect this final state.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Problem Identification:** The user correctly identified that while automated tests were passing, manual E2E testing showed that the financial metrics were incorrect and misleading.
    2.  **Strategic Decision:** The user and AI collaboratively decided that the most professional engineering approach was to revert the unstable analytics changes and tackle them as a separate, dedicated task with a more robust testing strategy.
    3.  **Code Reversion:** The AI reverted the recent changes in `crud_holding.py` and `crud_analytics.py` to their previous stable state.
    4.  **Documentation Sweep:** The AI was prompted to perform a full documentation update to mark the core Corporate Actions feature as "Done" while ensuring all other documents (`README.md`, `product_backlog.md`, etc.) accurately reflect that the advanced analytics part has been deferred.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_holding.py`: **Reverted** to remove dividend-related P&L and total value calculations.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_analytics.py`: **Reverted** to remove dividend-related XIRR calculation logic.
    *   `docs/features/FR4.6_corporate_actions.md`: **Updated** status to "Done" and cleaned up obsolete requirements.
    *   `docs/product_backlog.md`: **Updated** to move the core Corporate Actions feature to completed and ensure advanced analytics are in the backlog.
    *   `README.md`: **Updated** the main feature list to accurately reflect the implemented features.
    *   `docs/workflow_history.md`: **Updated** with this entry.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full test suite using `docker-compose run --rm test` and other test commands to confirm the reverted state is stable and all tests pass.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The application is in a known-good, stable state. The core corporate action logging feature is functional, but the complex analytics calculations have been deferred. All project documentation is now accurate and consistent, ready for the next development cycle.

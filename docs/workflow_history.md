    1.  **Systematic Debugging via Log Analysis:** The core of the interaction was a highly iterative debugging loop. At each step, the failing `pytest` log was provided to the AI. This was critical for identifying and fixing a cascade of `AttributeError`, `ValidationError`, and `AssertionError` issues.
    2.  **Bug Filing:** For each distinct class of error, the "File a Bug" prompt was used to generate a formal bug report for `docs/bug_reports.md` before a fix was requested.
    3.  **Targeted Fix Requests:** After filing a bug, a prompt like "Give me the fix for this bug" or "Update this file" was used to apply targeted changes to the correct files.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/services/financial_data_service.py`: Implemented missing mock methods (`get_asset_price`, `get_asset_details`).
    *   `backend/app/tests/utils/transaction.py`: Updated test helper to provide required `exchange` field.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_portfolios_transactions.py`: Corrected test payloads to include the `exchange` field.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_dashboard.py`: Updated tests to mock the correct batch methods (`get_current_prices`, `get_historical_prices`) instead of the simple ones.
    *   `backend/app/crud/base.py` & `crud_user.py`: Refactored to use modern `db.get()` method, removing deprecation warnings.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite using `docker-compose run --rm test`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The backend is now fully stable and functional.
    - All 51 backend tests are passing. The application is ready for the next phase of development.

## 2025-07-23: Final E2E Testing & Stabilization

*   **Task Description:** Perform a full end-to-end smoke test of the application to verify all features work together seamlessly. This involved a highly iterative process of testing, analyzing logs, filing bug reports, and fixing issues across the entire stack. A final code quality review was also performed to add missing test coverage and improve code consistency.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **E2E Testing & Log Analysis:** The process was driven by prompts like "Let's run the final E2E smoke test" followed by "analyse log.txt" when an issue was found.
    2.  **Bug Triage & Fixing:** For each issue, the "report a bug" and "apply the fix" prompts were used to systematically document and resolve bugs. This included backend validation logic, frontend error display, mock data inconsistencies, and UI styling issues.
    3.  **Code Quality Review:** The final step was a proactive review requested via "Any code or test suits need to update, after recent bug fixes?", which led to adding critical test coverage and refactoring the frontend transaction creation flow for better maintainability.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_transaction.py`: Added validation to prevent selling more assets than owned.
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_dashboard.py`: Added error handling for price lookups in history calculation.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/assets.py`: Corrected logic to ensure new assets found via external services are saved to the local DB.
    *   `backend/app/services/financial_data_service.py`: Added missing mock prices to support E2E testing.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/test_transaction_validation.py`: Added a new test suite to cover the new transaction validation logic.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/AddTransactionModal.tsx`: Refactored to display specific error messages from the backend and to align with the new API service signature.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/PortfolioHistoryChart.tsx`: Fixed a UI styling bug on the active button.
    *   `frontend/src/hooks/usePortfolios.ts`, `frontend/src/services/portfolioApi.ts`, `frontend/src/types/portfolio.ts`: Refactored for better code quality and consistency.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/components/Portfolio/AddTransactionModal.test.tsx`: Updated test assertions to match the refactored code.
    *   `docs/bug_reports.md`: Added detailed reports for all bugs discovered and fixed during this phase (2025-07-23-09 to 2025-07-23-19).

*   **Verification:**
    - Performed a full E2E smoke test of the application, verifying all user flows.
    - Ran the full backend test suite (41 passed, 2 skipped) and frontend test suite (54 passed).

*   **Outcome:**
    - The application is stable, fully tested, and all MVP features are complete and working correctly end-to-end.

## 2025-07-27: Final Frontend Test Suite Stabilization

*   **Task Description:** Resolve the final two failing frontend test suites to achieve a fully stable and passing test run.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Log Analysis:** The user provided the final `log.txt` from `npm test`. The AI was prompted to analyze the log to identify the root causes of the failures.
    2.  **Bug Triage & Reporting:** The AI identified two distinct bugs in `AuthContext.test.tsx` (state leakage due to stale closures) and `DashboardPage.test.tsx` (Jest mock factory error). The "File a Bug" prompt was used to document these issues in `bug_reports.md`.
    3.  **Targeted Fixes:** The AI was prompted to provide the specific code changes to resolve these two bugs.

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`: Refactored to remove `useCallback` from the `login` and `logout` functions. This prevents the Axios interceptor from capturing stale function closures, which was causing state to leak between tests.
    *   `frontend/src/__tests__/pages/DashboardPage.test.tsx`: Refactored the `jest.mock` factories to return a function that returns the JSX. This is a standard pattern to work around a known Jest issue where using JSX directly in a mock factory conflicts with module hoisting.
    *   `docs/bug_reports.md`: Added the final two bug reports for the issues discovered.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full frontend test suite using `docker-compose run --rm frontend npm test`.

*   **Outcome:**
    - The frontend test suite is now fully stable. All 15 test suites and 58 tests are passing. The project is ready for the next phase of development.

## 2025-07-26: Pilot Release Stabilization

*   **Task Description:** Implement a series of critical features and bug fixes identified during E2E testing to prepare the application for a pilot release. This included P/L calculations, a flow for adding new assets, and implementing sliding sessions with refresh tokens.

*   **Key Prompts & Interactions:**
    1.  **Feature Implementation:** For each new feature, a plan was created, and then the relevant backend and frontend files were updated. This included `crud_dashboard.py` for P/L logic and the entire authentication flow for refresh tokens.
    2.  **Test Generation:** For each new backend endpoint (`/assets`, `/refresh`, `/logout`), a dedicated test suite was created to ensure correctness and security.
    3.  **Systematic Debugging:** The user provided clear descriptions of bugs (e.g., "user is getting logged out after 30 minutes"), which allowed the AI to identify the root cause and propose the correct architectural solution (refresh tokens).

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `backend/app/crud/crud_dashboard.py`: Implemented P/L calculations using the Average Cost Basis method.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/assets.py`: Added a `POST /assets/` endpoint to allow users to create new assets on the fly.
    *   `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`: Refactored to issue refresh tokens in a secure `HttpOnly` cookie and added `/refresh` and `/logout` endpoints.
    *   `backend/app/core/security.py`: Updated to create both access and refresh tokens with distinct types.
    *   `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`: Implemented a global Axios interceptor to handle automatic token refreshing.
    *   `frontend/src/components/Portfolio/AddTransactionModal.tsx`: Refactored to use the new asset creation flow.
    *   `backend/app/tests/api/v1/`: Added `test_assets.py` and `test_auth.py` to provide full test coverage for the new endpoints.

*   **Verification:**
    - Ran the full backend test suite (53 passed).

*   **Outcome:**
    - The application is now feature-complete for the pilot release. All critical bugs have been fixed, and the user experience has been significantly improved with the addition of P/L data and sliding sessions.

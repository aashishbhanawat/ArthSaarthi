**Date:** 2025-07-31

We are excited to announce the first pilot release of the Personal Portfolio Management System (PMS)! This version is a fully functional, self-hostable application that includes all the core features required for basic portfolio tracking and analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features in This Release

*   **Secure Authentication:** A complete authentication system, including a one-time initial setup for the first admin user, standard user login/logout, and secure session management.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of your financial health, including:
    *   Total portfolio value.
    *   Realized and Unrealized Profit/Loss calculations.
    *   Top daily market movers.
    *   Interactive charts for portfolio value history and asset allocation.
*   **Full Portfolio & Transaction Management:**
    *   Create and manage multiple, distinct portfolios.
    *   Add BUY/SELL transactions with robust backend validation to ensure data integrity (e.g., preventing the sale of unowned assets).
*   **On-the-Fly Asset Creation:** If an asset ticker isn't in the local database, you can create it instantly from the "Add Transaction" modal, which validates the ticker against an external financial data service.
*   **Admin User Management:** A dedicated, admin-only dashboard for performing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all application users.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

*   **Data Source:** The application uses the `yfinance` library for market data, which is free but can have data delays or occasional availability issues. It is not suitable for real-time trading decisions.
*   **Analytics:** The current P/L and Top Movers calculations are based on simplified logic suitable for the pilot. More advanced metrics (like XIRR, Sharpe Ratio) are planned for future releases.
*   **Disclaimer:** This application is intended for personal, informational use only and is not a financial trading platform.

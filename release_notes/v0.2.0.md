# Release v0.2.0 - Advanced Usability & Data Import

**Date:** 2025-08-23

We are thrilled to announce the release of **ArthSaarthi v0.2.0**! This is a major update driven directly by feedback from our pilot users and a desire to dramatically improve usability and data management. This release focuses on reducing manual data entry, providing deeper insights, and making the application more accessible than ever.

## âœ¨ What's New in This Release

### 1. Automated Data Import

The most significant new feature is the full-stack **Automated Data Import** workflow. You can now upload transaction statements directly, drastically reducing manual entry.

*   **Multi-Stage Workflow:** A simple process to **Upload**, **Preview**, and **Commit** transactions.
*   **Intelligent Parsers:** Built-in support for **Generic CSVs**, **Zerodha Tradebooks**, and **ICICI Direct Tradebooks**.
*   **Asset Alias Mapping:** If your statement uses an unrecognized ticker (e.g., `INFY-BE`), you can map it to the correct asset in your database on the fly. The system will remember this mapping for future imports.
*   **Data Integrity:** The system automatically sorts transactions by date before committing, ensuring that out-of-order data in your source file is handled correctly.

### 2. Complete Portfolio Page Redesign

The portfolio detail page has been completely overhauled to provide a more intuitive and analytical view.

*   **Consolidated Holdings View:** Instead of a raw transaction list, you now see a clean, consolidated table of your current holdings, with sortable columns for quantity, value, and P/L.
*   **Holdings Drill-Down:** Click on any holding to open a modal showing the detailed buy/sell transaction history that makes up that specific holding.
*   **Full Transaction CRUD:** You can now **Edit** and **Delete** transactions directly from the UI.

### 3. Advanced Analytics

Go beyond simple returns with on-demand calculation of key performance metrics.

*   **XIRR & Sharpe Ratio:** Calculate the Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR) and Sharpe Ratio for your entire portfolio or for individual assets.

### 4. Native Desktop Installers

For users who prefer a non-Docker setup, we now provide native desktop installers for a simple, single-user experience.

*   **Multi-Platform Support:** Installers are automatically built for **Windows (.exe)**, **macOS (.dmg)**, and **Linux (.AppImage, .deb)**.
*   **SQLite Backend:** The desktop version uses a secure, file-based SQLite database, requiring no external database setup.

### 5. Under-the-Hood Improvements

*   **Database Portability:** The backend now officially supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite.
*   **Pluggable Caching:** The hard dependency on Redis has been removed. The application can now use a file-based cache, simplifying non-Docker deployments.

## ðŸš€ How to Get Started

*   **For Desktop Users:** Go to the project's **GitHub Releases** page and download the installer for your operating system (`.exe`, `.dmg`, or `.AppImage`).
*   **For Self-Hosters (Docker):** The process remains the same. Download the source code and follow the instructions in the main `README.md` to run the application with Docker Compose.

## What's Next?

Our next development cycle will focus on adding support for more asset classes (like Fixed Deposits and Bonds), handling corporate actions (dividends, splits), and building a dedicated, filterable transaction history page.

Thank you for your continued support!

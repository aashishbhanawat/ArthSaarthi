## 4. Module Development (Stage 4 - Iterative: Feature by Feature) üöÄ

This stage will be repeated for each module/feature identified in the requirements. The Master Orchestrator will decide which module to develop next based on the Agile backlog.

**Roles involved in each iteration:** Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Database Administrator, QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer.

### Master Orchestration Prompt for Module Development

"We are now entering **Stage 4: Module Development**. We will develop features one by one in an Agile manner. I will specify the feature, and you will invoke the relevant AI roles to plan, implement, and test it.

For each feature, we'll follow these steps:
1.  **Feature Definition & Context Scaffolding:**
    *   Define the current feature to be developed.
    *   Request a full project file listing (`ls -R`) to build an accurate context map and prevent code duplication.
2.  **Backend Development Planning (Backend Developer & Database Administrator):**
    * API Endpoints (new/updated)
    * Database Schema Changes (new tables, columns, relationships)
    * Proposed Backend Files/Folders
3.  **Frontend Development Planning (Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer):**
    * UI Components
    * Proposed Frontend Files/Folders
    * User Interactions
4.  **Code Generation Request:** Once plans are confirmed, request the AI to generate the code.
5.  **Testing & Debugging Workflow (QA Engineer & All Roles):**
    *   **Testing Plan:** The QA Engineer will define unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance criteria.
    *   **E2E Test Plan:** The QA Engineer will also define a high-level E2E test case to be added for the feature.
    *   **Rigorous RCA:** When an error occurs, the AI must analyze the **full stack trace**, validate dependencies by requesting to see imported files, and state its hypothesis before proposing a fix.
    *   **Local Testing Environment:** For development and testing in a non-Dockerized environment, refer to the instructions in `task_prompt/AGENTS.md`. This guide details how to use the `run_local_tests.sh` script to execute the full test suite.
    *   **Formal Bug Triage:** Before filing a new bug, the AI must search the temporary bug log (`docs/bug_report_temp.md`) for existing issues. It will propose updating an existing bug before creating a new one. The main `docs/bug_reports.md` file is for historical context only.
    *   **No Debugging Loops:** If a proposed fix does not work, the AI must not suggest the same fix again. It must re-evaluate its hypothesis, ask for more information (e.g., different logs, file contents), and propose a new, distinct path forward.

6.  **Deployment/Environment Updates (DevOps Engineer):**
    *   A plan for database schema initialization (e.g., `create_all` for dev, migrations for prod).
    *   Docker/Deployment Script Updates
    *   Environment Variables
7.  **Code Generation Workflow:**
    *   **To prevent truncated responses for large, multi-file changes, first provide a list of all files that need to be created or modified.**
    *   **Then, ask the user which file they would like to see the changes for first.**
    *   **Proceed with generating the code for one file at a time, as directed by the user.**
7.  **Review and Iteration.**
8.  **Documentation & Commit Workflow:**
    *   Append a detailed entry to `docs/workflow_history.md` summarizing the task, key prompts used, a summary of the AI's output, a comprehensive list of file changes, verification steps, and the final outcome.
    *   Systematically update all other relevant project documents as per the checklist in `docs/COMMIT_TEMPLATE.md`.
    *   Generate a final, standardized commit message using the format specified in `task_prompt/COMMIT_TEMPLATE.md`.

**A `.gitignore` file should be created early in the process to exclude virtual environments, `.env` files, and `__pycache__` directories.**


You are now ready to start development of new module.

**All planned MVP features are now complete, stable, and covered by a foundational E2E test suite. "Real Data Integration (FR5)" was completed in a previous release.**

The next priority is to complete the **Automated Data Import (FR7)** feature. The backend for this feature is partially implemented but contains stubs.

Before we proceed with development, we will first run all test suites (backend, frontend, E2E) to ensure there has been no regression. After confirming the stability of the application, we will begin completing the backend implementation for FR7.

Now, let's proceed with the full test suite execution.
